        <h1>Zardoz</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1974</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> science fiction film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Zardoz is a 1974 science fantasy film written, produced, and directed by John Boorman and starring Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling. It depicts a post-apocalyptic world where barbarians (the Brutals) worship the stone idol Zardoz while growing food for a hidden elite, the Eternals. The Brutal Zed becomes curious about Zardoz, and his curiosity forces a confrontation between the two camps.
Boorman decided to make the film after his abortive attempt at dramatising The Lord of the Rings. Burt Reynolds was originally given the role of Zed, but subsequently declined it due to illness. His place was taken by Sean Connery, who wanted to reinvent himself after portraying James Bond. It was shot entirely in County Wicklow in the east of Ireland.</p>
