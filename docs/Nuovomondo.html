        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2006</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Italy</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Golden Door (Italian: Nuovomondo, literally "new world") is a 2006 drama film based on a family's migration from Italy to New York City, U.S.A. at the beginning of the 20th century. The film, written and directed by Emanuele Crialese, opens on location in Sicily and concludes in the United States. (The Ellis Island sequences were shot at a studio in Rome and in Buenos Aires, Argentina.) Vincent Schiavelli, whose character was originally planned to play a major part, died during the filming, forcing his role to become a supporting character.
The movie premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 8, 2006 to critical praise and seven nominations (with six wins) at the festival. Many praised the director's focus on sound and visual composition. Others focused on the lack of typical iconography of the time (such as the Statue of Liberty). 
Martin Scorsese was involved in the marketing, and introduced the film at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Although selected as the Italian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards, it was not nominated.</p>
