        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Wreck-It Ralph is a 2012 American animated comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Rich Moore and produced by Clark Spencer, from a screenplay written by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee, and a story by Moore, Johnston, and Jim Reardon. John Lasseter served as the filmâ€™s executive producer. Featuring the voices of John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and Jane Lynch, the film tells the story of Ralph, an arcade game villain who rebels against his "bad guy" role and dreams of becoming a hero.
The concept of Wreck-It Ralph originated in the late 1980s under the working title High Score and evolved through various iterations. Moore sought to capture an authentic video-game world by including real video game characters like Bowser, Clyde, and Doctor Eggman, while focusing on creating new characters. For animation, Disney introduced new reflectance functions and a real-time virtual camera system. The team researched candy factories and food photography to inspire the design of the Sugar Rush game world. Henry Jackman composed the score, and the soundtrack featured songs by Owl City, AKB48, and Skrillex, among others.
Wreck-It Ralph premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on October 29, 2012, and went into general release on November 2. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $496 million worldwide against a $165 million budget and winning the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, as well as receiving nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. A sequel, Ralph Breaks the Internet, was released on November 21, 2018.</p>
