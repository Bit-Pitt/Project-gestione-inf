        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Italy</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> "The Second Time" is the first single from Kim Wilde's fourth studio album Teases & Dares (1984). In North America, it was re-named "Go for It". The track was Wilde's first release on the MCA record label. Her last few releases on her original label had failed to make an impact commercially, but this one returned her to the charts of several European countries, peaking at number 29 in the United Kingdom. It also marked her second chart entry in the US, where it peaked at number 65.
The B-side, "Lovers on a Beach" (an exclusive non-album track), was also extended for the 12-inch single in some nations.</p>
