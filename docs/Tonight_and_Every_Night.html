        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1945</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> musical film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Tonight and Every Night is a 1945 American musical film directed by Victor Saville and starring Rita Hayworth, Lee Bowman and Janet Blair. The film portrays wartime romance and tragedy in a London musical show, loosely modelled on the Windmill Theatre in Soho, that determined not to miss a single performance during the Blitz. Hayworth plays an American showgirl who falls in love with an RAF pilot played by Bowman.
The film was adapted from Lesley Storm's 1942 play Heart of a City. It was used by Columbia Pictures as a Technicolor vehicle for Hayworth after her success with Cover Girl (1944), directed by Charles Vidor. A major highlight of the film is Hayworth in the "You Excite Me" number, often cited as one of her best performances.
The film was nominated for two Academy Awards at the 18th Academy Awards: Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Original Song (for "Anywhere").</p>
