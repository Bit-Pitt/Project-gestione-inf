        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2004</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Japan</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Three... Extremes (Chinese: 三更2; pinyin: Sāngēng 2; Korean: 쓰리, 몬스터; RR: Sseuli, Monseuteo; Japanese: 美しい夜、残酷な朝; Utsukushī Yoru, Zankokuna Asa) is a 2004 horror anthology film. A follow-up to Three (2002), it follows the same concept of three individual segments by directors from three East Asian countries.
The segments are, in order: Dumplings, directed by Fruit Chan (Hong Kong), Cut, directed by Park Chan-wook (South Korea), and Box, directed by Takashi Miike (Japan).
Dumplings was also released as a theatrical feature film the same year, with additional scenes and a different ending. Although a sequel to Three, Extremes was released before the original in the United States, leading Three to be released in the United States as Three... Extremes II, repackaged as a faux sequel.</p>
