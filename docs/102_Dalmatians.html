        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> 102 Dalmatians is a 2000 American crime comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures and distributed  by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Directed by Kevin Lima from a screenplay by Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White, based on a story by Buckley and Regan, it is the sequel to 101 Dalmatians (1996), which was a live-action remake of the 1961 animated film of the same name. It stars Glenn Close reprising her role as Cruella de Vil as she attempts to steal puppies for her "grandest" fur coat yet, with Ioan Gruffudd, Alice Evans, Tim McInnerny, Ian Richardson, GÃ©rard Depardieu, Ben Crompton, Carol MacReady, Jim Carter, Ron Cook, David Horovitch, Timothy West, and the voice of Eric Idle in supporting roles. Close and McInnerny were the only two actors from the 1996 film to return for the sequel, while Adrian Biddle and Anthony Powell reprised their respective duties as cinematographer and costume designer.
The film received mostly negative and unfavourable reviews from critics, and grossed a total of $183.6 million worldwide against a budget of $85 million, becoming a Box office bomb , although the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.
A backstory film in its own continuity, Cruella, was released on May 28, 2021, with Emma Stone in the title role and Close acting as an executive producer.</p>
