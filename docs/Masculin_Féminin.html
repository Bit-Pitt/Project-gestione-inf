        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1966</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Sweden</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Masculin féminin: 15 Specific Events (French: Masculin féminin: 15 faits précis, pronounced [maskylɛ̃ feminɛ̃ kɛ̃z fe pʁesi]) is a 1966 French New Wave film, written and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. An international co-production between France and Sweden, the film stars Chantal Goya, Jean-Pierre Léaud, Marlène Jobert, Catherine-Isabelle Duport and Michel Debord.
Léaud plays Paul, a romantic young idealist who chases budding pop star Madeleine (played by Goya, a real-life yé-yé singer). Despite markedly different musical tastes and political leanings, the two soon become romantically involved and begin a ménage à quatre with Madeleine's two roommates, Catherine (Duport) and Elisabeth (Jobert). The camera probes the young actors in a series of vérité-style interviews about love, lovemaking, and politics. At times the main story is interrupted by various sequences and subplots, including a scene paraphrased from LeRoi Jones' play Dutchman.
Masculin Féminin was intended as a representation of 1960s France and Paris. The film contains references to various pop culture icons and political figures of the time, such as Charles de Gaulle, André Malraux, James Bond, and Bob Dylan. Arguably the most famous quotation from the film is "This film could be called The Children of Marx and Coca-Cola", which is actually an intertitle between chapters.</p>
