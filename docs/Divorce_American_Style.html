        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Divorce American Style is a 1967 American satirical comedy film directed by Bud Yorkin and starring Dick Van Dyke, Debbie Reynolds, Jason Robards, Jean Simmons, and Van Johnson. Norman Lear produced the film and wrote the screenplay, based on a story by Robert Kaufman. It focuses on a married couple who opt for divorce when counseling fails to help them resolve their various problems, and the problems presented to divorced people by alimony. The title is an homage to Divorce Italian Style (1961). Some of the film's plot, such as the maritial separation, the attempt to remarry of one the divorcing spouses and the wife being presuaded to call off the divorce, also resembles the 1964 Andy Griffith Show episode with a similar title.
