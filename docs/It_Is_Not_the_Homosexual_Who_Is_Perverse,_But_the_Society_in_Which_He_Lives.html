        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Germany</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives  (German: Nicht der Homosexuelle ist pervers, sondern die Situation, in der er lebt) is a 1971 West German avant-garde film directed by Rosa von Praunheim.
The film was an emancipatory call for homosexuals to organize and fight for their freedom. It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse ... triggered the modern gay rights movement in West Germany and Switzerland and also found great resonance internationally. The film became a media scandal because conservative homosexuals and heterosexuals alike rejected the demands for equality in all areas of life and the call for public solidarity.
The film premiered at the 1971 Berlin International Film Festival. The US premiere took place in 1972 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the British premiere in the same year at the National Film Theatre in London.</p>
