        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Tarzan and the Mermaids is a 1948 American adventure film based on the Tarzan character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Directed by Robert Florey, it was the last of twelve Tarzan films to star Johnny Weissmuller in the title role, with the following sixteen (eighteen counting remakes) films in the series featuring alternating actors between main and supporting, while maintaining a single continuity. It was also the first Tarzan film since 1939 not to feature the character Boy, adopted son of Tarzan and Jane (Boy was described in the film as being away at school, and the character never returned to the series).
It was followed by Tarzan's Magic Fountain in 1949, starring Lex Barker as Tarzan, alongside a returning Brenda Joyce as Jane.</p>
