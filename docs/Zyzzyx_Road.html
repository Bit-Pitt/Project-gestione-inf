        <h1>Zyzzyx Road</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2006</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> thriller film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Zyzzyx Road ( ZIZ-iks), also called Zyzzyx Rd., is a 2006 American thriller film written, produced and directed by John Penney and starring Katherine Heigl, Leo Grillo,  and Tom Sizemore.
The film gained notoriety from its gross ticket sales of only $30 on its opening run, due to its intentionally limited release at a single cinema; it is the lowest-grossing film in U.S. history in terms of box office sales. It also was the film that grossed the lowest opening box office sales, until The Worst Movie Ever! (2011), which ended up with just $11 during its premiere.</p>
