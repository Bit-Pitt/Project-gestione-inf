        <h1>Tango & Cash</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1989</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Tango & Cash is a 1989 American buddy cop action comedy film starring Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Jack Palance, and Teri Hatcher. The film follows the titular pair of rival police detectives who are forced to work together after a criminal mastermind frames them for murder.
The film was chiefly directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, with Albert Magnoli and Peter MacDonald taking over in the later stages of filming, with Stuart Baird overseeing post-production. The multiple directors were due to a long and troubled production process, that included numerous script rewrites and clashes between Konchalovsky and producer Jon Peters over creative differences.
Tango & Cash was released by Warner Bros. in the United States on December 22, 1989, the same day as Always, making it one of the last American films of the 1980s. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, earning over $120 million on a $54 million budget.</p>
