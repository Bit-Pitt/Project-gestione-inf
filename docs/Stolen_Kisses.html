        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Stolen Kisses (French: Baisers volés) is a 1968 French romantic comedy-drama film directed by François Truffaut, starring Jean-Pierre Léaud, Delphine Seyrig, and Claude Jade. It continues the story of the character Antoine Doinel, whom Truffaut had previously depicted in The 400 Blows (1959) and the short film Antoine and Colette (1962). In this film, Antoine begins his relationship with Christine Darbon, which is depicted further in the last two films in the series, Bed & Board (1970) and Love on the Run (1979).
The original French title of the film comes from a line in Charles Trenet's song "Que reste-t-il de nos amours ?," which is also used as the film's signature tune. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.
The film begins with a pan onto the locked gates of the Cinémathèque Française, then based at the Palais de Chaillot. On the gates, there is a sign 'Relache' ('Closed'). This is Truffaut's reference to the Affaire Langlois when the head of the Cinémathèque had been fired by the French government. He was eventually reinstated after filmmakers such as Truffaut used all their wiles to foment protest.</p>
