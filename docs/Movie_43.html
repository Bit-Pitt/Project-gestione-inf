        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Movie 43 is a 2013 American anthology comedy film conceived by producer Charles B. Wessler. Featuring fourteen different storylines, each by a different director, including Elizabeth Banks, Steven Brill, Steve Carr, Rusty Cundieff, James Duffy, Griffin Dunne, Patrik Forsberg, James Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Brett Ratner, Will Graham, and Jonathan van Tulleken, the film stars an ensemble cast led by Banks, Kristen Bell, Halle Berry, Gerard Butler, Leslie Bibb, Kate Bosworth, Kieran Culkin, Josh Duhamel, Anna Faris, Richard Gere, Terrence Howard, Hugh Jackman, Johnny Knoxville, Justin Long, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, Chris Pratt, Liev Schreiber, Seann William Scott, Emma Stone, Jason Sudeikis, Uma Thurman, Naomi Watts, Jeremy Allen White and Kate Winslet. Julianne Moore, Tony Shalhoub, Bob Odenkirk, Anton Yelchin and Shane Jacobson appear in storylines not included in the film's theatrical release.
The project took almost a decade to get into production, and was eventually picked up by Relativity Media for $6 million. Filming took place over a period of several years, as casting also proved to be a challenge. Some, including George Clooney, declined to participate, while others, such as Richard Gere, attempted to get out of the project.
Released on January 25, 2013, after having been originally slated for release on April 13, 2012, Movie 43 was panned by critics, although it was a modest commercial success, grossing $32.4 million against a budget of $6 million. Considered one of the worst films of all time, the film received three awards at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture.</p>
