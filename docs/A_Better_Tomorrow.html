        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2010</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> action film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> South Korea</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A Better Tomorrow (Chinese: 英雄本色; lit. 'True Colors of a Hero') is a 1986 Hong Kong action film directed, co-written and co-produced by John Woo, co-produced by Tsui Hark, and starring Ti Lung, Leslie Cheung and Chow Yun-fat. The film had a profound influence on Hong Kong action cinema, and has been recognised as a landmark film credited with setting the template for the heroic bloodshed genre, with considerable influence on both the Hong Kong film industry and Hollywood.
Produced with a tight budget and released with virtually no advertising, A Better Tomorrow broke Hong Kong's box office record and went on to become a blockbuster in Asia. It is regarded as one of the greatest Chinese-language films ever made, ranking #2 on the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures list in 2005. Its success led to a sequel, A Better Tomorrow II, also directed by Woo, and A Better Tomorrow 3: Love & Death in Saigon, a prequel directed by Hark. It has been remade several times.
The film was Chow Yun-fat's breakout role and launched him as one of the top superstars in the Hong Kong film industry. Chow's character "Mark Lee" has been imitated by many fans even decades after the film's release. Following this film, Chow went on to make several more notable films with Woo.</p>
