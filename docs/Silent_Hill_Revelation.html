        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Canada</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Silent Hill: Revelation (also known as Silent Hill: Revelation 3D) is a 2012  supernatural horror film written and directed by M. J. Bassett and based on the video game series Silent Hill published by Konami.  It is the second installment in the Silent Hill film series. The film, produced as a sequel to  Silent Hill (2006), stars Adelaide Clemens, Kit Harington, Martin Donovan, Malcolm McDowell, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with Deborah Kara Unger, Sean Bean, and Radha Mitchell returning from the previous film. The plot follows Heather Mason (Clemens), who, discovering on the eve of her eighteenth birthday that her presumed identity is false, is drawn to the town of Silent Hill.
Talks for a Silent Hill sequel began in December 2006, with Christophe Gans returning to direct and Roger Avary writing. However, after Gans dropped out and Avary was imprisoned for vehicular manslaughter, the project entered development hell. Later, in early 2010, Bassett was hired to direct and write, replacing Gans and Avary. She had expressed her openness to fans' suggestions of actresses for the role of Heather. On an estimated $20 million budget, filming took place from March to May 2011 in Canada, with the 3D RED Epic camera used for the process; audio mixing took place in France.
Silent Hill: Revelation was released theatrically in North America on October 26, 2012, by Alliance Films and Open Road Films respectively; in France on November 28, by Metropolitan Filmexport. The film grossed over $55.9 million worldwide and received largely negative reviews from critics. A third film, Return to Silent Hill, is in post-production.</p>
