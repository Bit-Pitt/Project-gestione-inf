        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1998</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> South Korea</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Whispering Corridors (Korean: 여고괴담; RR: Yeogogoedam) is a 1998 South Korean supernatural horror film directed and co-written by Park Ki-hyung. It was part of the explosion in South Korean cinema following the liberalization of censorship in the aftermath of the end of the country's military dictatorship. The film makes a social commentary on authoritarianism and conformity in the harsh South Korean education system.
This film is the first installment of the Whispering Corridors film series, and was followed by five sequels (Memento Mori, Wishing Stairs, Voice, A Blood Pledge and The Humming), though none of the sequels share a continuing plot or characters with each other.</p>
