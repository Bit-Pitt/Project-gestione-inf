        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Resident Evil: Damnation, known as Biohazard: Damnation (Japanese: バイオハザード ダムネーション, Hepburn: Baiohazādo Damunēshon) in Japan, is a 2012 Japanese adult animated biopunk action horror film by Capcom and Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan, and is directed by Makoto Kamiya and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi. It features the voices of Matthew Mercer, Dave Wittenberg, Wendee Lee, and Courtenay Taylor.
The story revolves around DSO agent Leon S. Kennedy as he investigates biological weapons used in a European civil war. Kamiya aimed to tell a more original story by moving away from the narrative of the series, and asked for Capcom's aid in regards to the handling of the characters to make them consistent with their video game counterparts.
Damnation premiered on October 27, 2012, in Shinjuku, Tokyo. It was commercially successful, grossing more than $2 million in Japan and more than $3 million in home media format in the US. The film received positive reviews, and has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
