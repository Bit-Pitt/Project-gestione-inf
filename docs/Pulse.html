        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> In medicine, the pulse is the rhythmic throbbing of each artery in response to the cardiac cycle (heartbeat). The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery or ulnar artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery). The pulse is most commonly measured at the wrist or neck. A sphygmograph is an instrument for measuring the pulse.</p>
