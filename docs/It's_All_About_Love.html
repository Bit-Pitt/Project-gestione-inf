        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2003</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Canada</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> It's All About Love is a 2003 English-language Danish romance-drama film written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg. Its narrative can be classified as apocalyptic science fiction, but Vinterberg prefers to call it "a dream". Unlike the director's earlier Danish-language films, It's All About Love is entirely in English, and stars Joaquin Phoenix, Claire Danes and Sean Penn. The production was led by Denmark's Nimbus Film, but the film was largely an international co-production, with involvement of companies from nine different countries in total. It was very poorly received by film critics.</p>
