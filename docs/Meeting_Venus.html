This fictional story follows misadventures in making a modern Parisian production of the Wagner opera Tannhäuser, which in itself tells of the production of a singing contest.  "Here you can be misunderstood in six different languages."  The singing contest, the opera and the film explore the tension between sexuality and spirituality, punctuated by emotionally gripping vocal, choral and orchestral music.  "Without hard work, there are no miracles," and in spite of committed, passionate people, the results are in doubt to the final moment in each performance.</p>
