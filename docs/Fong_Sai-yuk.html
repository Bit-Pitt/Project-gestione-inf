        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Fong Sai-yuk (or Fang Shiyu) is a semi-fictional Chinese martial artist and folk hero from Zhaoqing City, Guangdong Province of the Qing dynasty. Fong was also associated with Hung Hei-gun and the Five Elders of the Southern Shaolin Monastery. He was a disciple of Shaolin and his martial arts techniques were considered to have contributed to the development of Hung Ga Kuen.
He was first mentioned in wuxia stories dating from the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), such as Shaolin Xiao Yingxiong (少林小英雄; Young Hero of Shaolin), Wan Nian Qing (萬年青) and Qianlong You Jiangnan (乾隆游江南; The Qianlong Emperor Visits Jiangnan).
Although Fong Sai-yuk is a fictional character, the stories about him treat him as if he really existed. He has been the subject of various novels, movies and dramas. Stories about Fong have been adapted into films and television series since 1949. The most notable ones are the 1993 Hong Kong film Fong Sai-yuk and its sequel, which both starred Jet Li.</p>
