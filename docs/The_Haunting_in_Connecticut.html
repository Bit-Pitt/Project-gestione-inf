        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Haunting in Connecticut is a 2009 supernatural horror film directed by Peter Cornwell and starring Virginia Madsen, Kyle Gallner, Martin Donovan, Amanda Crew, and Elias Koteas. The film is alleged to be about Carmen Snedeker and her family, though Ray Garton, author of In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting (1992), has publicly distanced himself from the accuracy of the events he depicted in the book. The film's story follows the fictional Campbells as they move into a house (a former mortuary) to mitigate the strains of travel on their cancer-stricken son, Matt. The family soon becomes haunted by violent and traumatic events from supernatural forces occupying the house.
The film was moderately successful, grossing about $78.8 million at the box office. it received "generally unfavorable reviews" according to Metacritic. In 2010 Gold Circle Films announced the production of a sequel, The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia (released 2013) They noted, however, that the film wouldn't be a direct sequel to The Haunting in Connecticut and would instead be a self-contained film with unique characters.</p>
