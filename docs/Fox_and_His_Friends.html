        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1975</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Germany</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Fox and His Friends (German: Faustrecht der Freiheit, lit. 'Freedom's Law of the Jungle'; also known as Fist-Right of Freedom) is a 1975 West German drama film written and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, starring Fassbinder, Peter Chatel and Karlheinz Böhm. The plot follows the misadventures of a working-class gay man who wins the lottery, then falls in love with the elegant son of an industrialist. His lover tries to mold him into a gilt-edged mirror of upper-class values, and ultimately swindles the easily flattered "Fox" out of his fortune. The film is an incisive look at the relationship between money and emotions. Love is seen as a commodity that can be bought for money and lasts only as long as it is profitable.</p>
