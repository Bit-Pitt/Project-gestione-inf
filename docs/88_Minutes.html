In the film, famed forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm (Pacino) is one of the most sought-after profilers in the world.

However, on the eve of Forster's execution, one of Gramm's students is murdered in a vicious copycat crime, and Gramm receives an ominous message informing him that he has 88 minutes to live. Released on March 2, 2007, in Israel, and in the United States on April 18, 2008, 88 Minutes underperformed at the box office, grossing $32.6 million against a $30 million budget, and was panned by critics.</p>
