        <h1>Y tu mamá también</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2001</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Mexico</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Y tu mamá también (Spanish for And Your Mother Too) is a 2001 Mexican coming-of-age comedy drama road film directed by Alfonso Cuarón, who co-wrote the script with his brother Carlos. It follows two teenage boys who take a road trip with a woman in her late twenties and stars Diego Luna, Gael García Bernal, and Maribel Verdú, with narration by Daniel Giménez Cacho. It is set in 1999 against the backdrop of Mexico's political and economic realities, specifically at the end of the uninterrupted seven decades of presidents from the Institutional Revolutionary Party and the rise of the opposition led by Vicente Fox.
In addition to directing and co-writing the film, Cuarón also produced it with Jorge Vergara and edited it alongside Alex Rodríguez. The film's explicit depiction of sex, nudity, and drug use caused complications in its rating. In Mexico, it earned $2.2 million its first weekend, setting a new record for the highest box office opening in Mexican cinema. In 2002, it was released in English-speaking markets under its Spanish title, with a limited release in the United States. It received critical acclaim and was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards and as Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globe Awards.</p>
