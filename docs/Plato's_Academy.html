        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Academy (Ancient Greek: Ἀκαδημία, romanized: Akadēmía), variously known as Plato's Academy, or the Platonic Academy, was founded in Athens by Plato circa 387 BC. The academy is regarded as the first institution of higher education in the west, where subjects as diverse as biology, geography, astronomy, mathematics, history, and many more were taught and investigated. Aristotle studied there for twenty years (367–347 BC) before founding his own school, the Lyceum. The Academy persisted throughout the Hellenistic period as a skeptical school, until coming to an end after the death of Philo of Larissa in 83 BC. The Platonic Academy was destroyed by the Roman dictator Sulla in 86 BC.
A neo-Platonic academy was later established in Athens that sought to continue the tradition of Plato's Academy. This academy was shut down by Justinian in 529 AD, when some of the scholars fled to Harran, where the study of classical texts continued. In 1462 Cosimo de' Medici established the Platonic Academy of Florence, which helped initiate the Renaissance. In 1926 the Academy of Athens was founded again but this time with the founding principle of tracing  back the historical Academy of Plato.</p>
