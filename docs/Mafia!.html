        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Mafia!, also known as Jane Austen's Mafia!, is a 1998 American crime comedy film directed by Jim Abrahams and starring Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges (in one of his final films), Olympia Dukakis and Christina Applegate. It was Abrahamsâ€™ final directorial effort before his death in 2024.
The film spoofs Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather series and various other mafia films, notably Martin Scorsese's Casino (1995). It also parodies films in other genres, ranging from Forrest Gump to Il Postino and The English Patient.
In the film, a Korean War veteran avenges an assassination attempt on his crime boss father. The veteran subsequently manages a casino in Las Vegas, until surviving another assassination attempt. He sets out to gain vengeance, and to regain the love of his ex-girlfriend. By that point his girlfriend had been elected as the President of the United States, and he has to convince her to postpone her plans for world peace.</p>
