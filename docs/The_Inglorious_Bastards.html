        <h1>The Inglorious Bastards</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1978</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Italy</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Inglorious Bastards (Italian: Quel maledetto treno blindato, lit.â€‰'That damned armored train') is a 1978 Italian Euro War film directed by Enzo G. Castellari and starring Bo Svenson, Peter Hooten, Fred Williamson, Jackie Basehart, and Ian Bannen. The film, which concerns a group of prisoners who are drafted into a special war mission in 1944, is a loose (unauthorized) remake of the 1967 American film The Dirty Dozen.
The film attracted critics' attention again after Quentin Tarantino used the title as the inspiration for the title of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds. The Tarantino film is not a remake of The Inglorious Bastards, but contains a few references to it, including the appearances of Svenson as an American colonel and Castellari as a Wehrmacht general (although credited as "himself").</p>
