        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Mayor of Zalamea (Spanish: El Alcalde de Zalamea) is a play written by Pedro Calderón de la Barca (1600–1681) during the Golden Age of Spanish drama. It was probably written in 1636. It is likely the play had its premiere on May 12, 1636 in the court of Philip IV of Spain. It pays homage to a play by the same name by Lope de Vega, which it surpassed in fame through its superior character development, becoming one of the most well-known plays of its time. This play has three acts that explore the power of the self-made man against the political authorities of 17th century Spanish society, and the continuous struggle between corporate and individual honor. The play was first staged on Broadway in 1945 at the Majestic Theatre with a cast led by Herbert Berghof under the direction of James Light.</p>
