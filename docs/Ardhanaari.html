        <h1>Ardhanaari</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2012</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> LGBT-related film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> India</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Ardhanaari is a 2012 Indian Malayalam-language film about the life of transgender people in Kerala. The film is directed by Santhosh Souparnika and produced by M. G. Sreekumar under his production house MG Sound & Frames.
Manjula (Manoj K. Jayan), is a transgender hijra; her male physique and female behavioural traits lead to ridicule and snide remarks from her brother and others. The film concerns the rituals, customs, angst and preferences of hijra. The title of the film alludes to the half-male and half-female Hindu god Ardhanarishvara. Also starring in the film are Mahalakshmi, Maniyanpilla Raju, Thilakan, Sukumari and Sai Kumar. It was one of the last films featuring Thilakan, who died from a heart attack weeks before the release of the film.
Ardhanaari garnered mixed critical reviews, as did Jayan's performance.</p>
