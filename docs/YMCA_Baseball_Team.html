        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> YMCA Baseball Team (Korean: YMCA 야구단; RR: YMCA Yagudan) is a semi-historical 2002 South Korean comedy film.
In 1905, there was a confluence of international events leading to the loss of Chosŏn Korean sovereignty, and by 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea outright. The Japanese, having already defeated Qing China (1895) and signed an alliance with the United Kingdom (1902), defeated Imperial Russia (1905), and came to an understanding with the United States (the Taft-Katsura Agreement of 1905) to respect each other's colonial "Spheres of Influence" in the Pacific. In these chaotic times, an eclectic group of Koreans find refuge in the quintessentially American pastime.</p>
