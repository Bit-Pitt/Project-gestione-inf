Comic-book icon Stan Lee appeared, as did Brian O'Halloran, the star of Smith's breakout feature Clerks.
Plans for a sequel film titled MallBrats were announced in March 2015. By the following year, the project was proposed to be a television miniseries, but by February 2017, Smith announced that he had not been able to sell the series to any network. In January 2020, Smith revealed that development on a sequel film had started again, this time under the title Twilight of the Mallrats.
Mallrats has had three versions released: the main version, an extended version, and a theatrical version. The theatrical release has a total of 100 differences between the extended and original version.</p>
