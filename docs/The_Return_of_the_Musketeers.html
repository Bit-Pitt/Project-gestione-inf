        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1989</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>

        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Return of the Musketeers is a 1989 film adaptation loosely based on the novel Twenty Years After (1845) by Alexandre Dumas. It is the third Musketeers film directed by Richard Lester, following 1973's The Three Musketeers and 1974's The Four Musketeers. Like the other two films, the screenplay was written by George MacDonald Fraser.
The character of Mordaunt, Milady de Winter's son in the original novel, is replaced by Milady's daughter, called Justine de Winter.
Several cast members from the first two reprised their roles in this one. Jean-Pierre Cassel, who played Louis XIII in the original films, has a cameo appearance as Cyrano de Bergerac.
While filming in September 1988, character actor Roy Kinnear died following an on-camera accident in which he fell off a horse. His role was completed by using a body double, filmed from the rear, and dubbed-in lines from a voice artist.</p>
