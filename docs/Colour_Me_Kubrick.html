        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Colour Me Kubrick: A True...ish Story (U.S. title: Color Me Kubrick) is a 2005 comedy-drama film directed by Brian W. Cook and written by Anthony Frewin. It stars John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a British con-man who impersonated director Stanley Kubrick for several years in the 1990s. The film follows a fictionalized version of Conway as he goes from person to person, convincing them to give out money, liquor, and sexual favours for the promise of a job on "Kubrick's" next film. In real life, Frewin was Kubrick's long-time personal assistant, and Cook was assistant director on three of Kubrick's films.</p>
