        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> La Noche de Walpurgis /Walpurgis Night (released in the United States as The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman, in the UK as Shadow of the Werewolf, and in Canada as Werewolf Shadow), is a 1970 Spanish/German horror film starring Paul Naschy, the fifth in his series about the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky.  This film was directed by Le√≥n Klimovsky and written by Paul Naschy, and is generally regarded to have kickstarted the Spanish horror film boom of the 1970s (as well as Naschy's career). This was Naschy's all-time most financially successful film. It was also the first of 8 films that he would make with director Leon Klimovsky at the helm.</p>
