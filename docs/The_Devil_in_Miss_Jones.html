        <h1>The Devil in Miss Jones</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1973</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> pornographic film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Devil in Miss Jones is a 1973 pornographic film, written, directed and produced by Gerard Damiano, inspired by the 1944 play No Exit by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Starring Georgina Spelvin and Harry Reems, it is widely regarded as a classic adult film, released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969â€“1984). After his 1972 success with Deep Throat, Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania.
Alongside Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door, The Devil in Miss Jones is associated with a time in American culture known as "porno chic", in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert). The film went on to spawn numerous remakes and sequels.
As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of The Devil in Miss Jones is unresolved. VCX claims a copyright; rival distributor Arrow Productions distributed unauthorized copies for a time before 2009, when (as part of a mutual truce between the companies) Arrow agreed to accept VCX's claim in exchange for not challenging Arrow's claim on Deep Throat.</p>
