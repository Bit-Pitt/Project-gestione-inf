A complete version of the film had been considered lost for years.  A digitally restored and  reconstructed version premièred on 17 September 2011.  The restored film includes the original music by composer Eduard Künneke that had been commissioned for the film by Lubitsch.
Lubitsch is thought to have made The Loves of Pharaoh to show Hollywood that he could make an epic. The Loves of Pharaoh was his last German feature before he migrated to Hollywood in 1923.</p>
