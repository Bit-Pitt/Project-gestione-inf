        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2010</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> fantasy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Hungary</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Nutcracker in 3D (also released as The Nutcracker: The Untold Story) is a 2010 3D Christmas musical fantasy film adapted from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1892 ballet The Nutcracker. Directed, co-written and produced by Andrei Konchalovsky, the film stars Elle Fanning, Nathan Lane, John Turturro, Frances de la Tour, Richard E. Grant and Yulia Vysotskaya, with Charlie Rowe and Shirley Henderson as the Nutcracker. Set in 1920s Vienna, the plot follows a young girl who receives a magical doll that is revealed to be a prince and embarks on an adventure to save his kingdom from the Rat King.
An international co-production of the United Kingdom, Russia and Hungary, the film was panned by critics upon release, and was criticised for its story, deviations from the ballet, offputting and oftentimes disturbing visuals, the decision to adapt Tchaikovsky's score into lyrical musical numbers, and the artistic direction to allude to World War II and the Holocaust, and make the Rats reminiscent of Nazis. It bombed at the box-office, grossing $20 million against a $90 million budget.</p>
