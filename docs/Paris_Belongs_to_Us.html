        <h1>Paris Belongs to Us</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1961</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> France</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Paris Belongs to Us (French: Paris nous appartient, sometimes translated as Paris Is Ours) is a 1961 French mystery film directed by Jacques Rivette in his feature-length directorial debut. Set in Paris in 1957 and often referencing Shakespeare's play Pericles, the title is highly ironic because the characters are immigrants or alienated and do not feel that they belong at all.
The story centres on young university student Anne who, through her older brother, meets a group of people haunted by mysterious tensions and fears and the deaths of two of its members. The source of the malaise affecting the group is never explained, leaving viewers to wonder how far it might be an amalgam of individual imbalances, general existentialist anxiety, or the paranoia of the Cold War as the world faced the possibility of nuclear annihilation.</p>
