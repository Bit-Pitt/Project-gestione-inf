        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Practical Magic is a 1998 American romantic fantasy film based on the 1995 novel Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman. The film was directed by Griffin Dunne and stars Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing, Aidan Quinn, and Goran Višnjić.
Bullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, descended from a long line of witches. Raised by their aunts after their parents' death from a family curse, the sisters were taught the uses of practical magic as they grew up. As adults, Sally and Gillian must use their magic to destroy the evil spirit of Gillian's abusive boyfriend before it kills them.
The film was released on October 16, 1998. The film grossed $68.3 million worldwide against a $75 million budget. Upon initial release, the film received mixed reviews from critics who found the film's combination of different genres, including supernatural fantasy, domestic abuse drama, romantic comedy, and crime procedural, to be jarring. It has since gained a cult following for its cast, soundtrack, and feminist themes. In 2024, a sequel was reported to be in development.</p>
