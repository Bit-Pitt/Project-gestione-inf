        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1999</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> South Korea</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Ring Virus (Korean: ÎßÅ; RR: Ring) is a 1999 South Korean horror film adapted from the Japanese novel Ring by Koji Suzuki. A joint project between Japan and Korea, this version has Park Eun-Suh as the creator of the cursed videotape. Although the filmmakers claimed that the film was adapted from the novel only, it differs from the novel in some ways that match the 1998 film Ring (also known as Ringu in the US), such as having a female lead character, and several scenes were directly copied, including some of the scenes on the videotape and the film's climax.
At the time of the film's production, South Korea had placed a ban on Japanese cultural imports, which would have prevented Ring from being released in the country. The Ring Virus was commissioned as a remake for the South Korean market. By late 1998 the ban had been lifted, however production for the film had already progressed to near completion, and the film was released on 12 June 1999.</p>
