        <h1>BASEketball</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1998</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> BASEketball is a 1998 American sports comedy film cowritten and directed by David Zucker, starring South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and costarring Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy, Robert Vaughn, Ernest Borgnine and Dian Bachar.
The film is about BASEketball, a hybrid sport combining baseball and basketball, invented by Zucker in the 1980s. Parker and Stone play childhood friends who envision it as something they could win against athletes. It becomes an overnight sensation and a target of corporate sponsorship.
This is the only work involving the stars that was neither written, directed nor produced by them. It was a box office disappointment with mixed critical reviews, but in the years since its release has gained a cult following and is credited with coining the slang term "derp".</p>
