        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Piagol (Korean: 피아골) is a 1955 South Korean film directed by Lee Kang-cheon. It deals with a North Korean army unit that refuses to accept the armistice that effectively ended the Korean War in 1953. Instead, they hole up around Mt. Jiri and continue to operate. It is based on real historical events.
It was initially banned due to its supposedly "pro-communist" content, but the director launched a protest to have the film re-released.</p>
