        <h1>Inspector Gadget 2</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2003</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Inspector Gadget 2 (sometimes called Inspector 2 Gadget and IG2) is a 2003 American superhero comedy film released direct-to-video on VHS and DVD on March 11, 2003 as a standalone sequel to the 1999 film Inspector Gadget. It was based on the 1983 cartoon series created by DIC Entertainment.
Unlike the first film (which has a serious and darker tone and received a PG rating), Inspector Gadget 2 received a G rating and is considered a more faithful adaptation of the original animated series; the characters' personalities were altered to more closely match those of their cartoon counterparts and Doctor Claw's face is never shown in full. Additionally, Gadget and Claw are never referred to as "John Brown" and "Sanford Scolex", their respective civilian names from the first film, although Claw's communicator is still labeled as "Scolex Industries". Critics praised the cast and faithfulness to the source material but criticized the visual effects, writing, and humor. Some critics considered the film to be slightly better than the first.
None of the actors from the first film reprised their roles, with the exception of D. L. Hughley, who returned as the voice of the Gadgetmobile.</p>
