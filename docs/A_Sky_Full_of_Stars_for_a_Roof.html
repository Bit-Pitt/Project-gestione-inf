        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A Sky Full of Stars for a Roof (Italian: ...e per tetto un cielo di stelle) is a 1968 Italian Spaghetti Western comedy film.
It is the second western film directed by Giulio Petroni. At first the director was to be Franco Giraldi, but then he moved to direct A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die and Petroni replaced him. The film was generally praised for its opening sequence, that was defined by several critics as one of the best in the whole spaghetti western genre.
Scenes from this were used to create the film-within-the-film in Giuliano Montaldo's 1978 made for TV thriller Closed Circuit.</p>
