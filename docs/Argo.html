        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> In Greek mythology, the Argo ( AR-goh; Ancient Greek: Ἀργώ, romanized: Argṓ) was the ship of Jason and the Argonauts. The ship was built with divine aid, and some ancient sources describe her as the first ship to sail the seas. The Argo carried the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece from Iolcos to Colchis. After the journey, the ship was retired and dedicated to Poseidon, the divine ruler of the seas.
The ship has gone on to be used as a motif in a variety of sources beyond the original myth from books, films and more.</p>
