        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Marathon Family (Serbian: Маратонци трче почасни круг / Maratonci trče počasni krug, lit. Marathon Runners Do a Lap of Honour, or often simply Maratonci, lit. The Marathon Runners) is a 1982 Yugoslav black comedy film written by Dušan Kovačević and directed by Serbian director Slobodan Šijan. It has become a cult film in Serbia and other countries from the territory of the former Yugoslavia and is regarded as one of the classics of Yugoslav Serbian cinematography.
The film depicts a family of undertakers with a dark secret. Instead of making coffins, they steal ones from graves in the cemetery. They are increasingly indebted to a local hoodlum for his services. Following the death of the head of the family, conflict begins between the family and the hoodlum. The youngest member of the family kills his cheating girlfriend in a jealous rage, and then claims the family's leadership for himself. His term in office starts with a brutal showdown with the hoodlum and a police chase.</p>
