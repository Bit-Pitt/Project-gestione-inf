        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Mathias Kneißl) [in English: "Kneissel"], known as Robber Kneissl (in German Räuber Kneißl, in Austro-Bavarian Raiba Kneißl), (4 August 1875 in Unterweikertshofen – 21 February 1902) was a German outlaw, poacher and popular antihero in the Bavarian folklore of the Dachau district when the Kingdom of Bavaria was part of the German Empire. Chased by scores of green-uniformed rural policemen, who were already widely considered to be corrupt and who were further disliked for being Franconians who could not speak the local Upper Bavarian dialect, Kneissl became a folk hero to the local population because of his repeated humiliations of the police. According to German forensic scientist Mark Benecke, Mathias Kneissl never saw himself as a Robin Hood figure and was, in reality, "just a man who went astray with no way of getting back."</p>
