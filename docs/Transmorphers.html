        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> action film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Transmorphers is a 2007 American science fiction alien invasion film released direct-to-DVD on June 26, 2007. It was written and directed by Leigh Scott and produced by David Michael Latt and The Asylum, "a studio whose work gets slightly more respect than the Girls Gone Wild series, and slightly less than backyard-wrestling DVDs", according to Keith Phipps of AVClub. Transmorphers was developed as a mockbuster, intending to capitalize on both Transformers (2007) and Terminator 3 (2003).</p>
