        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The White Dream (German: Der weiße Traum) is a 1943 musical comedy film directed by Géza von Cziffra and starring Olly Holzmann, Elfriede Datzig and Wolf Albach-Retty.  The film was made by Wien-Film, a Vienna-based company set up after Austria had been incorporated into Greater Germany following the 1938 Anschluss.
It was one of the most popular wartime German releases. In the year following 1945, it was still found by an American military survey to be among a group of very successful Nazi era entertainment films at the box office, well ahead of foreign imports.</p>
