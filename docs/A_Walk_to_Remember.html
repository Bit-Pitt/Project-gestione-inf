        <h1>A Walk to Remember</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2002</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A Walk to Remember is a 2002 American coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Adam Shankman and written by Karen Janszen, based on Nicholas Sparks' 1999 novel of the same name. It stars Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote and Daryl Hannah, and was produced by Denise Di Novi and Hunt Lowry for Warner Bros. Pictures.
The novel's 1950s setting was changed from the late 1990s to early 2000s for the film, as the producers were concerned it might not appeal to teenage audiences. This film was shot from April to May of 2001 for nearly 40 days in Wilmington, North Carolina, with many of the sets borrowed from the television series Dawson's Creek. The film, like the book, is dedicated to the memory of Sparks's sister, Danielle, whose cancer-afflicted life inspired the story.
A Walk to Remember was theatrically released on January 25, 2002, and grossed $47.5 million worldwide on an $11.8 million budget. Rotten Tomatoes called the film "wholesome" but at the same time "bland and oppressively syrupy".</p>
