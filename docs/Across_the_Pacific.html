        <h1>Across the Pacific</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1942</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Across the Pacific is a 1942 American spy film set on the eve of the entry of the United States into World War II. It was directed first by John Huston, then by Vincent Sherman after Huston joined the United States Army Signal Corps. It stars Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, and Sydney Greenstreet. Despite the title, the action never progresses across the Pacific, concluding in Panama. The original script portrayed an attempt to avert a Japanese plan to invade Pearl Harbor. When the real-life attack on Pearl Harbor  occurred, production was shut down for three months, resuming on March 2, 1942, with a revised script changing the target to Panama.
The screenplay by Richard Macauley was an adaptation of a Saturday Evening Post serial by Robert Carson, “Aloha Means Goodbye”, published June 28–July 26, 1941.
Warner Bros. used the same title for a 1926 silent adventure film starring Monte Blue, who has a small role in this picture. However, the plots of the two films have no similarities.</p>
