        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is a 2003 American action comedy film and spy film directed by McG and written by John August, and Cormac and Marianne Wibberley. It is the sequel to 2000's Charlie's Angels and the second film in the Charlie's Angels trilogy, which is a continuation of the story that began with the television series of the same name by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts.
In an ensemble cast, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu reprise their roles as the three women working for the Townsend Agency. Crispin Glover, Matt LeBlanc and Luke Wilson also reprise their roles from the first film in addition to Bill Murray appearing through archival footage with Bernie Mac, Justin Theroux, Robert Patrick and Demi Moore joining the cast. Jaclyn Smith reprised her role as Kelly Garrett from the original series for a cameo appearance. It was John Forsythe's final film role before he retired from acting in 2006 and death in 2010 respectively.
It was released in the United States on June 27, 2003, by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label and was number one at the box office for that weekend, also making a worldwide total of $259.2 million. Like its predecessor, the film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Diaz, Barrymore and Liu, but criticism aimed at the "bland plot and lack of sense".</p>
