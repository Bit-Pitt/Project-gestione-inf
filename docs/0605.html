        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2004</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Netherlands</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> 06/05, called May 6th in most English-speaking countries, is a Dutch 2004 film directed by Theo van Gogh, based on the novel De Zesde Mei by Tomas Ross.
The film is a fictional version of the events that led to the assassination of the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn on 6 May 2002. The lines between reality and fiction are blurred in 06/05. It is the last film of Theo van Gogh, who was himself assassinated in 2004.
Theo van Gogh struck a deal with Dutch internet provider Tiscali over the film's finances. The movie was originally released in December 2004 on the internet, a situation that had never before been seen in the Netherlands; it could be watched via pay-on-demand. It was released in cinemas one month later, in January 2005.</p>
