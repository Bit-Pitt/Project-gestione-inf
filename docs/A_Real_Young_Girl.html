        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A Real Young Girl (French: Une vraie jeune fille) is a 1976 French drama film about a 14-year-old girl's sexual awakening, written and directed by Catherine Breillat. The film, Catherine Breillat's first, was based on her fourth novel, Le Soupirail.
This film is notable for its graphic depiction of sex scenes, which include Charlotte Alexandra exposing her breasts and vulva and the male actors displaying their penises. This led to the film being banned in many countries, and it was not released to theatres until 2000.</p>
