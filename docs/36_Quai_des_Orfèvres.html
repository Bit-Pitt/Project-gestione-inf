        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Direction régionale de la police judiciaire de la préfecture de police de Paris (DRPJ Paris), often called the 36 quai des Orfèvres or simply the 36 (trente-six) by the address of its headquarters, is the seat of the Paris regional division of the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police. Its 2,200 officers investigate about 15,000 crimes and offences a year.
The Judicial police (Police judiciaire; abbreviated PJ), is the criminal investigation division of the Police nationale.
36 quai des Orfèvres is often erroneously believed to be the address of the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police, the national authority of the criminal police, which is actually located at 11 rue des Saussaies, in the buildings of the Ministry of the Interior.
Since September 2017, DRPJ have their new headquarters at 36 rue du Bastion. This new building concentrated all services (before they were in different places). Only the Research and Intervention Brigade stay at 36 quai des Orfèvres.</p>
