        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Space Mutiny is a 1988 South African/American space opera science fiction film whose credited director is David Winters and replaced by Neal Sundstrom during production. Produced by Hope Holiday and shot in South Africa, it stars Reb Brown, Cisse Cameron, Cameron Mitchell, James Ryan, and John Phillip Law.
The film is about a mutiny aboard the generation ship known as the Southern Sun which is stopped with the aid of a visiting pilot, the protagonist.
Upon the first shooting day, it was announced to director David Winters that his father had died. Being emotionally troubled and with a funeral to attend, Winters was unable to perform his duties and passed it on to his assistant director Neal Sundstorm. However, he was informed that the investors had agreed to the film only if Winters was its director, and could face litigation if he withdrew, hence his credit. After its release, Winters disowned the film.
The film has the reputation of being an amusing, unintentionally funny, and campy B-movie. It was later included in an episode of the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000.</p>
