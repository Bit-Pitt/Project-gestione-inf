        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2007</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> pornographic film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Brazil</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> 2 Girls 1 Cup is the unofficial nickname of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a 2007 Brazilian scat fetish pornographic film produced by MFX Media. The trailer features two women defecating into a cup, taking turns in what appears to be consuming the excrement, and vomiting into each other's mouths. "Lover's Theme" by Herv√© Roy plays throughout the video.
The video became one of the best-known shock videos in itself and for the reactions its graphic content elicited from viewers who had not seen it before. Around mid-October 2007, video-sharing sites including YouTube were flooded with videos of the reactions of first-time viewers.</p>
