        <h1>Pink Floyd – The Wall</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1982</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United Kingdom</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Pink Floyd The Wall is a 1982 British musical drama film directed by Alan Parker, based on Pink Floyd's 1979 album The Wall. The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters. The Boomtown Rats vocalist Bob Geldof made his film debut as rock star Pink, who, driven to neurosis by the pressures of stardom and traumatic events in his life, constructs an emotional and mental wall to protect himself. However, this coping mechanism eventually backfires, and Pink demands to be set free.
Like its associated album, the film is highly metaphorical, and frequently uses both visual and auditory symbols throughout its runtime. It features little dialogue, instead being driven by the music from the album throughout. The songs used in the film have several differences from their album versions, and one of the songs included, "When the Tigers Broke Free", does not appear on the album. Despite its turbulent production, the film received generally positive reviews and has an established cult following among Pink Floyd fans.</p>
