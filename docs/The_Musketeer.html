        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2001</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Musketeer is a 2001 American actionâ€“adventure film based on Alexandre Dumas's classic 1844 novel The Three Musketeers, directed and photographed by Peter Hyams, and starring Catherine Deneuve, Mena Suvari, Stephen Rea, Tim Roth and Justin Chambers.
The film features Tsui Hark's regular actor Xin-Xin Xiong as a stunt choreographer and performer. Released days before the September 11 attacks, it was moderately successful in North America but did not perform well in other countries, and received largely negative reviews from critics. It is recognized by the department of Gers as the first Musketeers adaptation to incorporate authentic scenery from the real d'Artagnan's home region.</p>
