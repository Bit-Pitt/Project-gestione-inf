        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1984</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Yugoslavia</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Elusive Summer of '68 (Serbo-Croatian: Varljivo leto '68; Serbian Cyrillic: Варљиво лето '68) is a 1984 Yugoslav film directed by Goran Paskaljević.  It depicts a summer dominated by protests, as seen from the point of view of a teenage boy in Yugoslavia. 
Through collaborative work, director Goran Paskaljević and screenwriter Gordan Mihić have created a film that is both a love story and a political comedy set in the summer of 1968. The protagonist, high school graduate Petar, spends his summer in an idyllic and patriarchal province where the echoes of tumultuous global and domestic political events reach. His world is populated by women who are the objects of his youthful desires—married ladies, shy peers, provocative professors, and others.
Parallel to the film, a television series with the same name was also produced, which was broadcast in the same year on Radio Television Belgrade. The Yugoslav Film Archive included the film among the one hundred Serbian feature films that were declared of great cultural significance on December 28, 2016.</p>
