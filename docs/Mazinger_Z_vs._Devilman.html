        <h1>Mazinger Z vs. Devilman</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1973</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> action film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Japan</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Mazinger Z vs. Devilman (マジンガーＺ対デビルマン, Majingā Zetto tai Debiruman) is a 1973 animated movie that crossed over two then-popular anime series, both of which were created by manga artist Go Nagai. 
The movie features alternate versions of events from both series and is therefore not canonical to either one.</p>
