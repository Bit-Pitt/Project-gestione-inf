        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2004</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> South Korea</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The national flag of the Republic of Korea, also known as the Taegeukgi (Korean: 태극기; Hanja: 太極旗), has three parts: a white rectangular background, a red and blue taegeuk in its center, accompanied by four black trigrams, one in each corner. The predecessors to the current Taegeukgi were used as the national flag of Korea by the Joseon dynasty, the Korean Empire, as well as the Korean government-in-exile during Japanese rule. South Korea adopted Taegeukgi for its national flag in 1948.</p>
