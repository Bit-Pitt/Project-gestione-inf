        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Seven Year Itch is a 1955 American romantic comedy film directed by Billy Wilder, who co-wrote the screenplay with George Axelrod. Based on Axelrod's 1952 play of the same name, the film stars Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell, with the latter reprising his stage role. It contains one of the most iconic pop culture images of the 20th century, in the form of Monroe standing on a subway grate as her white dress is blown upwards by a passing train. The titular phrase, which refers to waning interest in a monogamous relationship after seven years of marriage, has been used by psychologists.</p>
