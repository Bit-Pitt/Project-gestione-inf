        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2004</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Sweden</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A Hole in My Heart (Swedish: Ett hål i mitt hjärta) is a 2004 Swedish  experimental drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson, starring Thorsten Flinck, Sanna Bråding, Björn Almroth and Goran Marjanovic. The story revolves around a man who makes a pornographic film in his apartment with a male friend and a woman, while his teenage son stays in his room and listens to ambient noise music.
The film is notable for its explicit imagery, including close-ups of vaginal reconstruction surgery, an uncomfortable anal sex scene, a masturbation scene with a toothbrush, and an extended scene about the woman's vagina. Moodysson leaves the interpretation of the film to the viewer: "I have cooked you a delicious meal, but I'm not going to chew it for you."</p>
