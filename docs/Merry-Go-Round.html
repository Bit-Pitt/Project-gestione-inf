        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A carousel or carrousel (mainly North American English), merry-go-round (international), Galloper (international) or roundabout (British English) is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The "seats" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music.
Carousels are commonly populated with horses, each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs (45 kg), but may include a variety of mounts, for example pigs, zebras, tigers, or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns. Sometimes, chair-like or bench-like seats are used, and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars.
The names roundabout, carousel and merry-go-round are also used, in varying dialects, to refer to a distinct piece of playground equipment.</p>
