        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>

        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Once Upon a Time, Cinema (Persian: ناصرالدین‌شاه آکتور سینما, lit. 'Naser al-din Shah, Actor of Cinema') is a 1992 Iranian comedy fantasy film written and directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf.
The film includes clips from old Iranian films from the silent age onwards. Made in black-and-white (with a brief colour sequence), it parodies many of the conventions of silent slapstick comedy and early fantasy films.</p>
