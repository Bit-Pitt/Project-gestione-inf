The film was shot predominantly in Chicago with some pickups and reshoots in Los Angeles. It was the final film to be produced under the Trans World Entertainment label.
Travolta plays Bobby Allen, a down-on-his-luck single father and recovering alcoholic whose wife died of a drug overdose. With no job and no money, he turns to Cissy, his late wife's brother, for a job as a money courier, while his 10-year-old daughter finds a wounded fighting dog. She takes care of the dog over her father's objections, until Bobby is betrayed by Cissy, who blames him for his sister's death.  Desperate, Bobby steals Cissy's money and flees with the girl to California, leaving the dog behind.  The dog follows them across the country to be reunited with the girl, while Cissy pursues Bobby to retrieve his money and take the girl.</p>
