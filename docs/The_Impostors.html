        <h1>The Impostors</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1998</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Impostors is a 1998 American farce film, directed, written, and produced by Stanley Tucci, starring Oliver Platt, Tucci, Alfred Molina, Tony Shalhoub, Steve Buscemi, Hope Davis, Elizabeth Bracco, Lili Taylor, Michael Emerson, Allison Janney, Allan Corduner, Isabella Rossellini, and Billy Connolly.
The film, in which Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci play a Laurel and Hardy-like odd couple of out-of work actors, is set in the depression-era 1930s; indeed, the retro style of the film is a re-creation of 1930s screwball comedy.  The opening silent sequence harks back to the golden days of silent film.
The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.</p>
