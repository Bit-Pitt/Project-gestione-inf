        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> In music, a reprise ( rə-PREEZ, French: [ʁəpʁiz] ; from the verb reprendre 'to resume') is the repetition or reiteration of the opening material later in a composition as occurs in the recapitulation of sonata form, though—originally in the 18th century—was simply any repeated section, such as is indicated by beginning and ending repeat signs.
A partial or abbreviated reprise is known as a petite reprise ( pə-TEET rə-PREEZ, French: [p(ə)tit ʁəpʁiz]). In Baroque music this usually occurs at the very end of a piece, repeating the final phrase with added ornamentation.</p>
