        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1944</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> musical film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Hollywood Canteen operated at 1451 North Cahuenga Boulevard in the Los Angeles, California, neighborhood of Hollywood between October 3, 1942 and November 22, 1945, as a club offering food, dancing, and entertainment for enlisted men and women, who were usually on their way overseas during World War II. Even though the majority of visitors were US servicemen, the canteen was open to allied countries as well as women in all branches of service. Their tickets for admission were just their uniforms, and everything at the canteen was free of charge.
The canteen was co-founded by the actors Bette Davis and John Garfield. The East Coast counterpart was the New York Cityâ€“based Stage Door Canteen, which featured Broadway stars and was also celebrated in a film, Stage Door Canteen (1943).</p>
