        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2000</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Charlie's Angels is an American crime drama television series created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts for ABC. It originally aired from September 22, 1976, to June 24, 1981, airing for five seasons consisting of 115 episodes. It was produced by Spelling-Goldberg Productions. The show follows the crime-fighting adventures of three women working at a private detective agency in Los Angeles, California, and originally starred Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith in the leading roles and John Forsythe providing the voice of their boss, the unseen Charlie Townsend, who directed the crime-fighting operations of the "Angels" over a speakerphone. There were a few casting changes: after the departure of Fawcett at the end of the season 1, Cheryl Ladd joined in season 2 and remained in the show till the ending; When Jackson departed at the end of season 3, Shelley Hack joined for season 4, and she was subsequently replaced by Tanya Roberts in season 5.
Despite mixed reviews from critics and a reputation for merely being "jiggle television" that emphasized the sex appeal of the female leads, Charlie's Angels was a top ten hit in the Nielsen ratings for its first two seasons. After the third season, however, the show had fallen from the top 10, and by the fifth season, from the Top 30.
Charlie's Angels continues to have a 1970s American cult and pop culture following through syndication, DVD releases, and subsequent television shows. The show also spawned a media franchise with a film series started in 2000, which is a continuation of the series story with later generations of Angels. A reboot television series was broadcast in 2011, but was canceled after seven episodes.</p>
