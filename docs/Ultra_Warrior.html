This B list film is notable for its excessive use of stock footage and its poor quality. Some footage comes from other New Horizons films such as Lords of the Deep, Crime Zone, Battletruck, Battle Beyond the Stars, Wheels of Fire and Dune Warriors.
The Concorde theatrical release was filmed in Peru and was later cut up for the VHS release.</p>
