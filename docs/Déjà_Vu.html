        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Déjà vu (  DAY-zhah-VOO, -⁠VEW, French: [deʒa vy] ; "already seen") is the phenomenon of feeling as though one has lived through the present situation before. It is an illusion of memory whereby—despite a strong sense of recollection—the time, place, and context of the "previous" experience are uncertain or impossible. Approximately two-thirds of surveyed populations report experiencing  déjà vu  at least one time in their lives. The phenomenon manifests occasionally as a symptom of  seizure auras, and some researchers have associated chronic/frequent "pathological"  déjà vu  with  neurological  or  psychiatric 
 illness. Experiencing  déjà vu  has been correlated with higher  socioeconomic status, better educational attainment, and lower ages. People who travel often, frequently watch films, or frequently remember their dreams are also more likely to report experiencing déjà vu  than others.</p>
