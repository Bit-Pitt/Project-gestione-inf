        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> I Am Twenty (Russian: Мне двадцать лет, translit. Mne dvadtsat let) is a 1965 drama film directed by Marlen Khutsiev. It is Khutsiev's most famous film and considered a landmark of 1960s Soviet cinema.
The film was originally entitled Zastava Iliycha (known in English alternately as Ilyich's Gate or Lenin's Guard), but it was heavily censored upon completion, trimmed to half its original length, retitled and withheld from release until 1965. A restored 3-hour version was released in 1989, and is sometimes referred to by the original title.
The film follows the recently demobilized Sergei, a young man who returns to his Moscow neighborhood after two years of military service.</p>
