        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1999</p>

        <p><strong>Country:</strong> South Korea</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Attack the Gas Station (Korean: 주유소 습격 사건) is a 1999 Korean crime comedy film, directed by Kim Sang-jin and written by Park Jung-woo.
The film tells the story of a quartet of thugs who rob a gas station out of sheer boredom, having robbed it only a few days previously. Unable to get any money from the register, they take everyone hostage and start dispensing gas and keeping the money. The film becomes progressively more and more farcical, as the characters find different ways of amusing themselves, mostly through the mixed cast of characters that come in through the gas station. However, it's only a matter of time before they start upsetting the wrong people.
During the question and answer session at a screening during the 2000 Vancouver International Film Festival, director Kim Sang-jin indicated that the film inspired real-life copycats in South Korea.
The cast featured Lee Sung-jae, Yu Oh-seong, Yoo Ji-tae, and Lee Yo-won.
A sequel, Attack the Gas Station 2, was released on 2010.</p>
