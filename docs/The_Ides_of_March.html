        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Ides of March (; Latin: Idus Martiae, Medieval Latin: Idus Martii) is the day on the Roman calendar marked as the Idus, roughly the midpoint of a month, of Martius, corresponding to 15 March on the Gregorian calendar. It was marked by several major religious observances. In 44 BC, it became notorious as the date of the assassination of Julius Caesar, which made the Ides of March a turning point in Roman history.</p>
