        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2005</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Ring Two is a 2005 American supernatural horror film and sequel to the 2002 film The Ring, which was a remake of the 1998 Japanese film Ring. Hideo Nakata, director of the original Ring, directed this film in place of Gore Verbinski. Noam Murro was attached before Nakata, but left due to creative differences. Naomi Watts, David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase reprised their roles with Simon Baker, Elizabeth Perkins and Sissy Spacek joining the cast. This film also marks the debut of Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
The film was shot in Astoria, Oregon, and Los Angeles, California. Originally intended to be released on November 10, 2004, The Ring Two was released theatrically on March 18, 2005. Although it was met with a generally mixed critical reception, it opened in the United States with a strong $35 million in its first weekend, more than doubling the opening weekend of The Ring. Its final $76 million domestic gross was less than the original's $129 million, but it took $87 million internationally, for a total gross of $164 million.
It is the second installment of the American Ring series, and was followed by Rings (2017).</p>
