        <h1>The Brown Bunny</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2003</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Japan</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Brown Bunny is a 2003 independent erotic romantic road drama film written, directed, produced, photographed, and edited by Vincent Gallo. Starring Gallo and ChloÃ« Sevigny, it tells the story of a motorcycle racer on a cross-country drive who is haunted by memories of his former lover. It was photographed with handheld 16 mm cameras in various locations throughout the United States, including New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Ohio, Missouri, Utah, Nevada, and California.
Following a world premiere at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the film garnered a great deal of media attention because of an explicit scene where Sevigny performs unsimulated fellatio on Gallo, as well as a feud between Gallo and the film critic Roger Ebert. Ebert stated that The Brown Bunny was the worst film in the history of Cannes, although he later gave a re-edited version his signature "thumbs up", awarding the film three out of four stars.
The film received mixed and heavily polarized reviews from critics, and was nominated for several accolades, including the Palme d'Or. It won the FIPRESCI Prize from the Viennale. The film has since gained a small cult following.</p>
