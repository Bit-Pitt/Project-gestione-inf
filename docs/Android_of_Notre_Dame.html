        <h1>Android of Notre Dame</title>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1989</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> science fiction film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Japan</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Guinea Pig (ギニーピッグ, Ginī Piggu) is a Japanese horror (and later, black comedy) series that consists of six films, as well as two making-of documentaries. The series' original concept,  was envisioned by manga artist Hideshi Hino (who wrote and directed two films in the series). The series primarily focuses on situations involving graphic violence, gore, mutilation, torture, and murder.
The Guinea Pig series has garnered controversy for its depictions of violence. One or more entries in the series were suspected to have influenced Tsutomu Miyazaki, a serial killer who kidnapped and murdered four young girls. The second film in the series, Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood, was supposedly withdrawn from the market, and has achieved particular notoriety because of an incident in which American actor Charlie Sheen is said to have watched the film and believed that it depicted the actual killing and dismemberment of a real woman, prompting him to report it to authorities.
The Guinea Pig films were released on DVD by distributor Unearthed Films. As a tribute to the Japanese film series, Unearthed Films began producing a series of horror films titled American Guinea Pig.</p>
