        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> In the Electric Mist (French title: Dans la brume électrique) is a 2009 French/American mystery drama film directed by Bertrand Tavernier, and written by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary Olson-Kromolowski based on the novel In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead by James Lee Burke; it stars Tommy Lee Jones in the lead role of Louisiana police detective Dave Robicheaux.
The film has only been released in Europe and Asia. In the US it has been shown just twice, and this in author Burke's hometown of New Iberia, Louisiana. A trimmed-down version (102:00 minutes NTSC), cut by the studio, was released direct-to-DVD in the United States. A longer director's cut version (112:23 minutes) was released in the rest of the world and premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival. In 2009, the director's cut version won the Grand Prix at the first "Festival International du Film Policier de Beaune", which is the continuation of the "Festival du Film Policier de Cognac." It opened on 15 April 2009 in France to positive reviews, while reviews for the American version were mostly positive (64% on Rotten Tomatoes).
In December 2009, Tavernier released a book titled Pas à Pas dans la Brume Électrique (Step by Step into the Electric Mist), which is a day-by-day account of the shooting of this movie.
In the Electric Mist is a sequel to 1996's Heaven's Prisoners, also adapted from a Burke novel. The character of Dave Robicheaux at that time was an ex-homicide detective in the swamplands of Louisiana, and was portrayed by Alec Baldwin.
The film marked the acting debut of musician Buddy Guy as Sam "Hogman" Patin.</p>
