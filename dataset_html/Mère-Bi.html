The first Senegalese female journalist, she was deeply involved in the development of her country. Both an activist and a non-conformist, she fought for the emancipation of women from the beginning. She divided her life between France, where she studied, and Senegal, where she returned in 1957, sensing that independence was on its way.</p>
