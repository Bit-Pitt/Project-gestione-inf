        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Four Days of Naples (Italian: Quattro giornate di Napoli) was an uprising in Naples, Italy, against Nazi German occupation forces from 27 September to 30 September 1943, immediately prior to the arrival of Allied forces in Naples on 1 October during World War II.
The spontaneous uprising of Neapolitan and Italian Resistance against German occupying forces, despite their limited armament, and without proper organization or planning, successfully disrupted German plans to deport Neapolitans en masse, destroy the city, and prevent Allied forces from gaining a strategic foothold.
The city was subsequently awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. The four days are celebrated annually and were the subject of the 1962 film The Four Days of Naples.</p>
