        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> France</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Sex Is Comedy is a 2002 comedy-drama film written and directed by Catherine Breillat. It revolves around a director (Anne Parillaud) and her troubles filming an intimate sex scene between two actors who cannot tolerate each other.
Based on Breillat's experiences directing her 2001 film Fat Girl, the climax of the film features a recreation of a scene from that film, shot from the point of view of the crew, with Roxane Mesquida essentially reprising her role from the first film.</p>
