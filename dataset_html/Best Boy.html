        <h1>Best Boy</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1979</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> documentary film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> In a film crew, there are two kinds of best boy:  best boy electric (also known as the assistant chief lighting technician) and best boy grip (also known as the 2nd company grip). They are assistants to their department heads, the gaffer (in charge of electricals) and the key grip (lighting and rigging), respectively. In short, the best boy acts as the foreman for the department. A woman who performs these duties may be called best girl.  Recently, some film crews have begun adopting gender-neutral terms for job titles, with one example being "lead electric" as a replacement for the term "best boy" in the electrical department. In 2024, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees has most recently adopted the terms assistant chief lighting technician and 2nd company grip for the electric and grip departments, respectively.</p>
