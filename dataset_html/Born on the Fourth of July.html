        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Born on the Fourth of July, published in 1976, is the best-selling autobiography by Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam War veteran who became an anti-war activist. Kovic was born on July 4, 1946, and his book's ironic title echoed a famous line from George M. Cohan's patriotic 1904 song, "The Yankee Doodle Boy" (also known as "Yankee Doodle Dandy"). The book was adapted into the 1989 Academy Award-winning film of the same name directed and co-written by Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic, starring Tom Cruise as Kovic.</p>
