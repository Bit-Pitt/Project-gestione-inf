        <h1>Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1964</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Spaghetti Western</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Italy</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Hercules and the Treasure of the Incas (Italian: Sansone e il tesoro degli Incas) is a 1964 film written and directed by Piero Pierotti  and starring  Alan Steel. Originally conceived as a peplum film, given the contemporary success of A Fistful of Dollars, it was turned into a western film during the shootings, resulting in a bizarre crossover between the two genres. Although Alan Steel reverts to a Hercules-like character in the film's climax, the bulk of the film resembles a standard Spaghetti Western.</p>
