It was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival where it won an Honourable Mention. Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film as "an extremely engaging tale of life and love in a city where everything appears to be in a state of flux", and described it as "a smartly written and sharply observed comedy-drama. At its frequent best, pic has a fresh and larky charm that's reminiscent of fondly remembered French New Wave romances."
