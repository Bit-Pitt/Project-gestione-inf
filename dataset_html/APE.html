        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A*P*E, released in South Korea as King Kong's Great Counterattack (Korean: 킹콩의 대역습; RR: King Kong eui daeyeokseup), is a 1976 monster film. An international co-production between South Korea and the United States, the film was produced by Kukje Movies and the Lee Ming Film Co. (South Korea) and Worldwide Entertainment (U.S.), and was shot in 3-D using the Space-Vision process. Directed by Paul Leder and featuring special effects by Park Kwang Nam, the film stars Joanna Kerns, Rod Arrants and Alex Nicol. It marked an early film appearance by Kerns, later known for her work in television.
A*P*E was released at approximately the same time as Dino De Laurentiis' 1976 remake of King Kong. The film is regarded by some critics as a Z movie. In later years, the film was released under the titles Attack of the Giant Horny Gorilla (for its 1982 re-release on the grindhouse circuit) and Hideous Mutant (for its original home video release).</p>
