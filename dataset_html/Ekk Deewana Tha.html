        <p><strong>Country:</strong> India</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Ekk Deewana Tha (transl.â€‰There was a crazy lover) is a 2012 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film written and directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, featuring Prateik Babbar, Amy Jackson (her Hindi debut), and Manu Rishi in lead roles. The film is a remake of Menon's own 2010 bilingual film  Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (Tamil) / Ye Maaya Chesave (Telugu). It features reused soundtrack and film score composed by A. R. Rahman, while the cinematography and editing were handled by M. S. Prabhu and Anthony Gonsalves, respectively.
While in production, the film was titled Prem Katha but was renamed as Ekk Deewana Tha as the director wanted an abstract title for the film, similar to the original. The film, produced by Fox Star Studios, Photon Kathaas and RS Infotainment, was released on 17 February 2012 in two different versions with a number of endings to suit the taste of regional viewers. The film opened to mixed reviews and had a lukewarm reception at the box office.</p>
