        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Oki's Movie (Korean: 옥희의 영화; RR: Ok-hi-eui Yeonghwa) is a 2010 South Korean drama film written and directed by Hong Sang-soo.
In a multipart narrative divided into four chapters, Hong fashions a new kind of love triangle. Oki is a young and beautiful college student majoring in film production and torn between the affections of two men: an older cinema professor and a former student/budding filmmaker. As the story shifts perspectives and timelines, Hong depicts each relationship with the authentically awkward rhythms of real life.</p>
