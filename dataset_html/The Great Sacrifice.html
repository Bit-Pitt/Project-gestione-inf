        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Opfergang (The Great Sacrifice or Rite of Sacrifice) is a 1944 German film directed by Veit Harlan.  It is based on Rudolf G. Binding's work of the same title, with alterations for propaganda purposes.

The film was dubbed a "masterpiece" by Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek in 2012.</p>
