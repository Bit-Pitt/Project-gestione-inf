        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2008</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> fantasy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> An American Carol (released as Big Fat Important Movie in other territories) is a 2008 American satirical comedy film directed by David Zucker and written by Zucker, Myrna Sokoloff and Lewis Friedman. Using the framework of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, the film follows liberal filmmaker Michael Malone (a parody of Michael Moore) as he is visited by three spirits to teach him the importance of Independence Day. The film satirizes liberalism in the United States, with focus on Moore's documentaries. It stars Kevin Farley as Malone, alongside an ensemble supporting cast that includes Kelsey Grammer, Leslie Nielsen, Trace Adkins, Robert Davi, and Jon Voight.
Theatrically released on October 3, 2008, by Vivendi Entertainment, An American Carol received negative reviews from most critics, who found the film's humor and satire to be ineffective. It also was a failure at the box office grossing only $7 million against a $20 million budget. The film marked the final onscreen appearance by Dennis Hopper before his death in 2010.</p>
