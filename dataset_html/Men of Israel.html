        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2009</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> pornographic film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Israel</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Men of Israel is a 2009 gay pornographic film released by Lucas Entertainment studio.  Journalists from The Atlantic, Out Magazine and Yediot Aharonot noted it as a landmark film as the first pornographic movie shot on location with an all-Israeli cast; while Tablet magazine and the Los Angeles Times remarked on it being the first to feature an all-Jewish cast. Director Michael Lucas—who is Jewish and obtained his Israeli citizenship (made aliyah) in 2009—undertook the film as "a bold move to promote Israeli culture and tourism" and to counterbalance what he saw as biased portrayals of Israel in mainstream media.</p>
