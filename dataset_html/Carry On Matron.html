        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United Kingdom</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Carry On Matron is a 1972 British comedy film, the 23rd release in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958–1992). It was released in May 1972. It was directed by Gerald Thomas and features series regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Hattie Jacques, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor and Kenneth Connor. This was the last Carry On film for Terry Scott after appearing in seven films, and for Kenneth Cope after appearing in two.
Along with the next film in the series (Carry On Abroad, released later in 1972), it features the highest number of the regular Carry On team. The only regular members missing are Peter Butterworth – who was due to play Freddy but was unable because of other work engagements – and Jim Dale. Butterworth returned in a major role in Abroad, and Dale would return belatedly for Carry On Columbus in 1992.</p>
