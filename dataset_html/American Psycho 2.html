        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> American Psycho 2 (also known as American Psycho II: All American Girl) is a 2002 American slasher film directed by Morgan J. Freeman from a screenplay by Alex Sanger and Karen Craig. Starring Mila Kunis and William Shatner, it is a stand-alone sequel to the film American Psycho. Kunis portrays a criminology student who seeks to advance her career by murdering her classmates.
The screenplay for the film, entitled The Girl Who Wouldn't Die, originally had no association with American Psycho. After production began, the script was altered to connect the film with the original. American Psycho 2 was released direct-to-video on June 18, 2002. The film was panned by critics; the script was also denounced by Bret Easton Ellis, the author of the original novel, and Kunis later expressed regret for working on the film.</p>
