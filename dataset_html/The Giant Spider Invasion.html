        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Giant Spider Invasion is a 1975 American independent science fiction action horror film produced, composed and directed by Bill Rebane. Starring   Steve Brodie, Barbara Hale, Robert Easton, Leslie Parrish, and Alan Hale, it follows giant spiders that terrorize the town of Merrill, Wisconsin and its surrounding area. The script was written by having Rebane locking Easton in a cabin to on the incentive of being fed. The film was theatrically released in 1975 by Group 1 Films and enjoyed a considerable run to become one of the 50 top-grossing films of that year.
The Giant Spider Invasion received negative reviews upon release and has since achieved a cult following after its appearance in a 1997 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The film was shown at a Bill Rebane themed film festival in 2005. A musical remake for the film was also planned.</p>
