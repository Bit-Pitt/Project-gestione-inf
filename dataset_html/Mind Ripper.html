        <h1>Mind Ripper</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1995</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Mind Ripper (also known as The Hills Have Eyes III, The Outpost or Wes Craven Presents Mind Ripper) is a 1995 American horror film released on HBO. It stars Lance Henriksen and Giovanni Ribisi.
Although it is marketed in some areas as a sequel to the original The Hills Have Eyes and The Hills Have Eyes Part II, no actors, characters, or scenarios link it to those films. Its only connection, aside from the desert location, is producer Wes Craven, who wrote and directed the other two films, and his son Jonathan Craven, who is credited as a writer.</p>
