        <h1>The World Is Not Enough</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1999</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> action film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The World Is Not Enough is a 1999 spy film, the nineteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It was directed by Michael Apted, from an original story and screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Bruce Feirstein. It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The title is the translation of the motto on the Bond family coat of arms, first seen in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.
The film's plot revolves around the murder of billionaire businessman Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter Elektra, who was previously held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.
Filming locations included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the UK, with interiors shot at Pinewood Studios. Despite receiving mixed reviews, with the plot and Denise Richards' casting frequently targeted for criticism, The World Is Not Enough earned over $361 million worldwide, becoming the eighth highest grossing film of 1999. It was also the first Eon-produced Bond film officially released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures (MGM) instead of MGM subsidiary United Artists, the franchise's original owner and distributor.</p>
