        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Lonely Lady is a 1983 American drama film directed by Peter Sasdy, adapted from Harold Robbins' 1976 novel of the same name, believed to have been based on Robbins' memories of Jacqueline Susann.

The plot follows an aspiring screenwriter who deals with many abusive men in her attempts to achieve success in Hollywood. The Lonely Lady was the last adaptation of one of Robbins' novels before his death in 1997. Critically panned, the film was a box-office bomb, grossing only $1.2 million against a budget of between $6â€“7 million.</p>
