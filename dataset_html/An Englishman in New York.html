        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> "An Englishman in New York" is a song by Godley & Creme, from their 1979 album Freeze Frame. It is memorable for an innovative self-produced music video which involved Godley singing in front of Creme, as Creme conducted mannequins dressed up as members of a 1930s big band orchestra. This feature is a homage to scenes from the 1971 film The Abominable Dr. Phibes, directed by Robert Fuest.</p>
