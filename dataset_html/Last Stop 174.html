        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Last Stop 174 (Portuguese: Última Parada 174) is a 2008 Brazilian biographical crime drama film directed by Bruno Barreto, written by Bráulio Mantovani, produced by Moonshot Pictures and starring Michel Gomes and Marcello Melo, Jr.. The film relates a fictionalized account of the life of Sandro Rosa do Nascimento, a street kid in Rio de Janeiro that survived the Candelária massacre and, in 2000, hijacked a bus. On September 16, 2008, the film was chosen by the Ministry of Culture as the representative of Brazil in the Oscar competition for best foreign film at the ceremony in 2009, but was not nominated.
In rigorous reconstruction of the facts, the film was set in locations of downtown Rio de Janeiro, as the Candelária Church, the neighborhood of the Jardim Botânico, Tavares Bastos' favela (slum) and Curicica, over eight weeks, between July, August and September 2007.</p>
