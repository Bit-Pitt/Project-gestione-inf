Inkheart was the first part of a trilogy and was continued with Inkspell (2005), which won Funke a BookSense Book of the Year Award for Children's Literature in 2006. The trilogy was initially concluded with Inkdeath, but was revived in 2016 when Funke announced that a sequel called The Colour of Revenge (German: Die Farbe der Rache) would be published in 2018 in Germany. Although the book was still unpublished in 2020, Funke announced that the first fifteen chapters would be published digitally that same year, with subsequent chapters published periodically. The physical edition of the book was released on October 12, 2023 in Germany.
Following the release of the first Inkheart novel, New Line Cinema bought the film rights to all three books for a film adaptation. The film is directed by Iain Softley based on a screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire. It features an ensemble cast that includes Brendan Fraser, Helen Mirren, Paul Bettany, Jim Broadbent, Rafi Gavron, Andy Serkis and newcomer Eliza Bennett, among others. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews. In 2009, a video game based on the film was released for the Nintendo DS.</p>
