        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Cave of the Yellow Dog (Mongolian Шар нохойн там) is a 2005 Mongolian/German film written and directed by Byambasuren Davaa. The film was submitted as Mongolia's contender for the 2005 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It won the 2006 Deutscher Filmpreis Award for Best Children's Picture.
The story is a gentle fable about the limitations of life and its acceptance.  A girl learns the painful lesson of letting go of want and desire when her father insists on leaving her newfound stray dog.  However, the ending of the film offers hope—another lesson of life being full of changes and the consequences of change may bring unexpected rewards.</p>
