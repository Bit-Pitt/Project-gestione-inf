        <h1>The Saint in Palm Springs</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1941</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Saint in Palm Springs is a 1941 American mystery crime film directed by Jack Hively and starring George Sanders, Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. It was produced and released by Hollywood studio RKO Pictures. The film continued the screen adventures of the Robin Hood-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar, alias "The Saint", created by Leslie Charteris. This sequel was based upon a story by Charteris; however, many changes to his concept were made. Charteris later novelised his version of the film story as the novella "Palm Springs", contained within the 1942 collection The Saint Goes West. This was the sixth of eight in RKO's film series about The Saint.
The central cast was identical to the previous entry, The Saint Takes Over. Sanders returned as Templar (his final performance in the role), with Jonathan Hale making his own final appearance as Inspector Farnack (the character would next be seen in The Saint in Manhattan, a 1980s television pilot). Wendy Barrie makes her third and final appearance, once again playing a different character.   Paul Guilfoyle reprises the role of Clarence "Pearly" Gates from the previous film. The director, Jack Hively, was the son of the film's editor, George Hively. The storyline involves The Saint pursuing rare stamps at a Palm Springs, California hotel.</p>
