        <h1>Blood Simple</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1984</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Blood Simple is a 1984 American independent neo-noir crime film written, edited, produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and starring John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya and M. Emmet Walsh. Its plot follows a Texas bartender who is having an affair with his boss’s wife. When his boss discovers the affair, he hires a private investigator to kill the couple. It was the directorial debut of the Coens and the first major film of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld, who later became a director, as well as the feature-film debut of McDormand.
The film's title is derived from Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest (1929), in which the Continental Op muses: “This damned burg's getting me. If I don't get away soon I'll be going blood-simple like the natives.” Stylistically, the film has been noted for its blending elements of neo-noir, pulp crime stories and low-budget horror films. In 2001, a director's cut was released, the same year that it was ranked No. 98 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills.</p>
