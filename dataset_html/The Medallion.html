        <h1>The Medallion</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2003</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> fantasy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Medallion (Chinese: 飛龍再生/免死金牌) is a 2003 buddy action comedy film directed by Hong Kong film director Gordon Chan, who also wrote the screenplay with Bennett Joshua Davlin, Bey Logan, Paul Wheeler, and Alfred Cheung, who also produced.
The film stars Jackie Chan, Lee Evans, Claire Forlani, and Julian Sands. It was much less successful than Chan's other American films such as the Rush Hour film series, Shanghai Noon and its sequel, Shanghai Knights. The film was theatrically released on 15 August 2003 in Hong Kong and 22 August 2003 in the United States by TriStar Pictures. However, on the home media release, it was released by Screen Gems.
In the story, Eddie (Jackie Chan) is a Hong Kong police officer hired by Interpol to capture a crime lord known as Snakehead (Sands) and stop him from kidnapping a chosen boy with special powers and a medallion that gives superhuman power and immortality.
Much of the film features supernatural and mystical themes, though it is filled with action and comedy. The film received negative reviews from critics.  Even though the film's United States box office result was strong enough for Sony/TriStar Pictures to make profit, the film performed poorly at the worldwide box-office, and only grossed $34.3 million in worldwide box office against $35‒41 million production budget.</p>
