        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2010</p>

        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> My Soul to Take is a 2010 American slasher film produced, written, and directed by Wes Craven, marking the first time he's worked as all three since Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994. The film stars Max Thieriot as Adam "Bug" Hellerman, who is one of seven teenagers chosen to die following the anniversary of a serial killer's death. Denzel Whitaker, Raul Esparza, and Shareeka Epps also star. The film's title comes from a line in the prayer "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep", which reads "If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take": Craven previously used the prayer as a mantra by Nancy Thompson in A Nightmare on Elm Street.
My Soul to Take was released by Relativity Media on October 8, 2010. It was unsuccessful at the box office, grossing just $21 million against its $25 million budget, and received mostly negative reviews from critics.</p>
