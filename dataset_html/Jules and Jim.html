        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Jules and Jim (French: Jules et Jim [ʒyl e dʒim]) is a 1962 French New Wave romantic drama film directed, produced and co-written by François Truffaut. Set before, during, and after World War I, it follows a tragic love triangle involving French bohemian Jim (Henri Serre), his shy Austrian friend Jules (Oskar Werner), and Jules' girlfriend and later wife Catherine (Jeanne Moreau).
The film is based on a 1953 semi-autobiographical novel by Henri-Pierre Roché describing his relationship with young writer Franz Hessel and Hessel's wife Helen Grund. Truffaut came across the book in the mid-1950s at a shop in Paris, and later befriended Roché. The author approved of Truffaut's interest in adapting the work.
The film won the 1962 Étoile de Cristal, with Moreau winning that year's prize for best actress. The film was ranked #46 in Empire magazine's 2010 list of "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema".</p>
