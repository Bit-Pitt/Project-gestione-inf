        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Lay the Favorite is a 2012 American comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Frears and written by D.V. DeVincentis, and stars Bruce Willis, Rebecca Hall, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Joshua Jackson.

It premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival on January 21 and was released on December 7 by The Weinstein Company through its RADiUS-TWC distribution arm.

The film was a box-office bomb, grossing $1.5 million against a production budget of $14.7 million.</p>
