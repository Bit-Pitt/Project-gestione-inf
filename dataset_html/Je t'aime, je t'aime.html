        <h1>Je t'aime, je t'aime</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1968</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> science fiction film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> France</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Je t'aime, je t'aime ("I Love You, I Love You") is a 1968 French science fiction film directed by Alain Resnais from a screenplay by Jacques Sternberg. The plot centres on Claude Ridder (Claude Rich) who is asked to participate in a mysterious experiment in time travel when he leaves the hospital after a suicide attempt. The experiment, intended to return him after one minute of observing the past, instead causes him to experience his past in a disjointed fashion.
The film was listed to compete at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the countrywide wildcat strike that occurred in May 1968 in France.
While seldom ranked among Resnais's best works, Je t'aime, je t'aime has received positive reviews since its release. It has been cited as an influence on the 2004 Michel Gondry film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.</p>
