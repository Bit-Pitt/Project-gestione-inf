        <h1>Wings</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1927</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> A wing is a type of fin that produces both lift and drag while moving through air. Wings are defined by two shape characteristics, an airfoil section and a planform. Wing efficiency is expressed as lift-to-drag ratio, which compares the benefit of lift with the air resistance of a given wing shape, as it flies. Aerodynamics is the study of wing performance in air.
Equivalent foils that move through water are found on hydrofoil power vessels and foiling sailboats that lift out of the water at speed and on submarines that use diving planes to point the boat upwards or downwards, while running submerged. Hydrodynamics is the study of foil performance in water.</p>
