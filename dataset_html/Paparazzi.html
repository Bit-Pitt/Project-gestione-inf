        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Paparazzi are independent photographers who take pictures of high-profile people, such as actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, and other celebrities who go about their daily life routines. Paparazzi are known for their relentless pursuit of celebrities, often using long lenses and speedlite flashes or even following them in vehicles to capture personal, unflattering, or private moments. The photographs taken by paparazzi are commonly sold to tabloids, gossip magazines, and websites, where they are published to attract attention and increase sales. This type of invasive photography is often controversial because it can violate the privacy of the subjects involved.</p>
