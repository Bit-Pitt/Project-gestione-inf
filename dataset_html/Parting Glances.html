        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Parting Glances is a 1986 American drama film. The film was one of the first motion pictures to deal frankly and realistically with the subject of AIDS and the impact of the relatively new disease on the gay community in the Ronald Reagan era and at the height of the pandemic. It is considered by film critics an important film in the history of gay cinema. The story revolves around a gay couple facing the challenges of a long-distance relationship. The film was well-received for its detailed evocation of gay and gay-friendly urbanites in 1980s Manhattan.
The film's soundtrack includes the Bronski Beat songs "Love and Money," "Smalltown Boy" and "Why." First-time director Bill Sherwood died of complications due to AIDS in 1990.</p>
