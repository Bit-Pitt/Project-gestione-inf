        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Arthur and the Minimoys (French: Arthur et les Minimoys or Arthur and the Invisibles in the United States) is a 2006 English-language French live-action/animated fantasy film directed and co-written by French filmmaker Luc Besson. It is based on the first two books of the Arthur children's books series, Arthur and the Minimoys and Arthur and the Forbidden City, by Besson.
Arthur and the Minimoys was released theatrically in France on 29 November 2006 by EuropaCorp, followed by wide releases in a number of countries. It was re-released in France on 4 April 2007 with nineteen minutes of bonus footage. With a budget of €60 million, it was briefly the most expensive French film production, until it was surpassed by Astérix at the Olympic Games (2008). It was a box-office success in its home country. It received the Imagina Award in the category Prix du Long-Métrage. Its soundtrack album was released on 9 January 2007.
The film received its release in the United States under the title Arthur and the Invisibles by the now-defunct company The Weinstein Company, which sparked criticism for the changes including the animation, script, humor, and editing, though Freddie Highmore's performance and visual aspects were praised. This cut was a box-office bomb and is currently out-of-print although is only available on US and UK DVDs due the re-release of the film in its original format in 2023.
The film's success in France spawned a media franchise with two sequels, Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard (2009) and Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds (2010), and a spin-off, Arthur, malédiction (2022), as well as multiple video games, an animated television series and theme park attractions at Futuroscope and Europa-Park.</p>
