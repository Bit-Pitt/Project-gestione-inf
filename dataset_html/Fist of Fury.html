        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Fist of Fury (Chinese: 精武門) is a 1972 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Lo Wei and produced by Raymond Chow. The film stars Bruce Lee in his major role after The Big Boss (1971). Bruce Lee also worked as the film's action choreographer. In the film, Chen Zhen, a student of Huo Yuanjia, fights to defend the honor of the Chinese in the face of foreign aggression and also exact vengeance responsible for Huo's death.
The film was Lee's second kung fu film and also touched on sensitive issues surrounding Japanese colonialism. It also featured fairly realistic fight choreography for its time and also differs from other films in the genre for its historical and social references, especially to Japanese imperialism.
Fist of Fury grossed an estimated US$100 million worldwide (equivalent to over $800 million adjusted for inflation) against a budget of $100,000. It was the highest-grossing Hong Kong film until Bruce Lee's following film The Way of the Dragon (1972).</p>
