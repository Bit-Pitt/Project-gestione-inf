        <h1>While Paris Sleeps</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1923</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> While Paris Sleeps, aka The Glory of Love, is a 1923 American silent drama film based on the novel The Glory of Love by Leslie Beresford (a.k.a. "Pan"), directed by Maurice Tourneur, and starring Lon Chaney and John Gilbert. Whoever wrote the screenplay adaptation went uncredited, but some sources claim it was Wyndham Gittens. Special effects were by Floyd Mueller.
The film was actually made in 1920 under the title The Glory of Love, but for some unknown reason, it was only released in 1923, with the title inexplicably changed to While Paris Sleeps. It is likely the film's gruesome content may have caused its release to be held up for so long. The film was apparently never copyrighted properly. Tourneur may have bought the picture outright from whoever owned it and released it himself in 1923 under the new title.
The film is now believed to be lost. A still exists showing Chaney in the role of the sculptor Henri Santodos, and online is shown the poster.</p>
