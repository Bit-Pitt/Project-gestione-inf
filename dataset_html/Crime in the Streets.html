        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Crime in the Streets is a 1956 American crime drama film about juvenile delinquency directed by Don Siegel and based on a television play written by Reginald Rose. The play first appeared as an episode of The Elgin Hour directed by Sidney Lumet before being remade as a feature film directed by Don Siegel.
The film, starring James Whitmore and John Cassavetes, also featured actor Sal Mineo, who had previously appeared in Rebel Without a Cause.  From his role in Crime in the Streets, Mineo earned a Hollywood nickname, "The Switchblade Kid". Malcolm Atterbury, Virginia Gregg, and future director Mark Rydell had prominent roles.
Siegel adapted the play to a film by expanding some sequences but keeping much of the same cast.  His credited dialogue coach on the film was Sam Peckinpah.</p>
