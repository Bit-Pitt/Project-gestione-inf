        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (transl. Will You Marry Me?) is a 2004 Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by David Dhawan and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala. The film stars Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra with Amrish Puri, Kader Khan, Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav in supporting roles. Set primarily in Goa, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi follows the adventures of two men (Khan and Kumar) who try to win a woman's (Chopra) heart. It is loosely based on the film Anger Management (2003).
Wanting to re-invent himself, Dhawan decided to make a film that would deviate from his signature mass-market comedies in look and feel, approaching it as a romantic comedy. The screenplay was written by Dhawan's longtime collaborators Anees Bazmee and Rumi Jaffery. Although the film is set in Goa, it was not shot there. Instead, principal photography was done on two detailed sets created by Sharmishta Roy in Film City and Mauritius. Additionally, several scenes and songs were filmed on location in Mauritius.
Mujhse Shaadi Karogi was released on 30 July 2004 to positive reviews with praise for its direction, performances, music, cinematography, art direction, costumes and styling. With a box-office gross of ₹565 million, the film became the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film of the year. Mujhse Shaadi Karogi was nominated for three Filmfare Awards. The film received a leading 13 nominations at the 6th IIFA Awards, including Best Film, Best Director (Dhawan), Best Actor (Khan) and Best Actress (Chopra), winning five awards. It received 10 Screen Awards nominations, including Best Film.</p>
