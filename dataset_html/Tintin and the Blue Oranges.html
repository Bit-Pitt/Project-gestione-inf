        <h1>Tintin and the Blue Oranges</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1964</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> adventure film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Spain</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Tintin and the Blue Oranges (French: Tintin et les Oranges bleues) is a 1964 Franco-Spanish adventure comedy film directed by Philippe Condroyer and starring Jean-Pierre Talbot as Tintin. It was the second live-action film, with an original story based on characters from the comic book series The Adventures of Tintin, written and drawn by the Belgian artist Hergé. The accompanying book version is in photos and text rather than the usual comic-book style.
The term "blue orange" is a moderately popular image among the French, and was originally inspired by Paul Éluard's strange quote "Earth is blue like an orange" as a reference to the colour of the fruit when it rots.
The plot revolves around blue oranges, which can grow in desert conditions. They have a bitter and salty taste, which supposedly makes them inedible. Professor Calculus is kidnapped in order to assist another professor in improving the oranges.</p>
