The Mandarin Chinese title of the movie is taken from the last line of a poem written by the rebel leader Huang Chao, who had revolted against the Tang dynasty.
With a budget of US$45 million, it was at the time of its release the most expensive Chinese film to date, surpassing Chen Kaige's The Promise. It was chosen as China's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for the year 2006, but did not receive the nomination. The film was nominated for Costume Design. In 2007, it received fourteen nominations at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards and won Best Actress for Gong Li, Art Direction, Best Costume and Make Up Design and Best Original Film Song for "菊花台" (Chrysanthemum Terrace) by Jay Chou.
The plot is based on Cao Yu's 1934 play Thunderstorm (雷雨 pinyin: Léiyǔ), but is set in the Imperial court in ancient China.</p>
