Ta Ra Rum Pum was theatrically released in India by Yash Raj Films on 27 April 2007. The film emerged as a moderate commercial success, grossing â‚¹70 crore (US$8.1 million) worldwide, thus becoming the tenth highest grossing Hindi film of the year. It received mixed reviews from critics upon release, with praise for its setting, and Khan and Mukherji's performances, but criticism for its screenplay, length, and pacing.</p>
