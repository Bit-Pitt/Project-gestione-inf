        <h1>Gigli</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2003</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy drama</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Gigli ( ZHEE-lee) is a 2003 American romantic comedy crime film written, co-produced and directed by Martin Brest, and starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bartha, Al Pacino, Christopher Walken and Lainie Kazan.
Despite popular media giving attention to and interest in the film during production (primarily because stars Affleck and Lopez were romantically involved), Gigli was heavily panned, and in subsequent years, it has been considered one of the worst films of all time. It is also one of the most expensive box-office bombs in history, grossing $7.2 million against a $75.6 million budget. It is the most recent film that Brest directed.</p>
