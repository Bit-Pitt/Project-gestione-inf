        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2011</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Egypt</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Lust is an intense desire for something. Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality (see libido), money, or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food (see gluttony) as distinct from the need for food or lust for redolence, when one is lusting for a particular smell that brings back memories. It is similar to but distinguished from passion, in that properly ordered passion propels individuals to achieve benevolent goals whilst lust does not.</p>
