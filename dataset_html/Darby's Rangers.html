        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Darby's Rangers (released in the UK as The Young Invaders) is a 1958 American war film starring James Garner as William Orlando Darby, who organizes and leads the first units of United States Army Rangers during World War II. Directed by William Wellman, the picture was shot by Warner Brothers Studios in black and white, to match wartime stock footage included in the production. It was inspired by the 1945 book Darby's Rangers: An Illustrated Portrayal of the Original Rangers, by Major James J. Altieri, himself a veteran of Darby's force.
The leading role was Garnerâ€™s first. Jack Warden and Stuart Whitman appear in support.</p>
