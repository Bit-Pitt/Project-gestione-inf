        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> India</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Jab Tak Hai Jaan (transl. As Long as I Live), abbreviated as JTHJ, is a 2012 Indian Hindi-language romantic drama film directed by Yash Chopra and written and produced by his son Aditya Chopra under their banner Yash Raj Films. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif, and Anushka Sharma.
The story revolves around Samar Anand (Khan), a bomb disposal expert whose diary falls into the hands of an intern Akira Rai (Sharma); the diary recounts his time as a struggling immigrant in London, and later details his whirlwind romance with Meera Thapar (Kaif).
Becoming Chopra's fourth film to feature Khan in the lead role, Jab Tak Hai Jaan marked the second collaboration between Khan and Sharma, as they previously featured in Yash Raj Films' Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), which was the latter's debut whereas this film was the first between Khan and Kaif. Chopra returned to direction 8 years after Veer-Zaara (2004), and Jab Tak Hai Jaan was his final film before his death in October 2012.
Released during the six-day Diwali weekend beginning on 13 November 2012, Jab Tak Hai Jaan received positive reviews from critics who praised Chopra's direction and the performances of Khan and Sharma, but criticised the predictable plot. The film earned â‚¹2,350,000,000 (US$27 million) worldwide and emerged as one of the year's top-earning films. It became the 3rd highest-grossing Bollywood film overseas at that time after 3 Idiots (2009) and My Name Is Khan (2010). 
At the 58th Filmfare Awards, the film received 7 nominations, including Best Actor (Khan), and won 4 awards, including Best Supporting Actress (Sharma) and Best Lyricist (Gulzar for "Challa").</p>
