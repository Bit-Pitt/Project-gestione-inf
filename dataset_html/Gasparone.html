        <h1>Gasparone</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1937</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> musical film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Germany</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Gasparone is an operetta in three acts by Carl Millöcker to a German libretto by Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée. The libretto was later revised by Ernst Steffan and Paul Knepler. An amusing feature of the work is that the title character never appears and acts as a scapegoat upon which all the misdeeds in Syracuse, Sicily, can be blamed.</p>
