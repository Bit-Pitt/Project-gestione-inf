        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> In the Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah () were two cities destroyed by  God for their wickedness. Their story parallels the Genesis flood narrative in its theme of God's anger provoked by man's sin (see Genesis 19:1â€“28). They are mentioned frequently in the prophets and the New Testament as symbols of human wickedness and divine retribution, and the Quran also contains a version of the story about the two cities.</p>
