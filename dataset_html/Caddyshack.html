        <h1>Caddyshack</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1980</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Caddyshack is a 1980 American sports comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, written by Brian Doyle-Murray, Ramis and Douglas Kenney, and starring Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight (his final film role), Michael O'Keefe and Bill Murray with supporting roles by Sarah Holcomb, Cindy Morgan, and Doyle-Murray. It tells the story of a caddie, vying for a caddie scholarship, who becomes involved in a feud on the links between one of the country club's founders and a nouveau riche guest. A subplot involves a greenskeeper who uses extreme methods against an elusive gopher.
Caddyshack was the directorial debut of Ramis and the film boosted the career of Dangerfield, who was then known primarily as a stand-up comedian. Grossing nearly $40 million at the domestic box office (the 17th-highest of the year), it was the first of a series of similar "slob vs. snob" comedies.
The film has a cult following and was described by ESPN as "perhaps the funniest sports movie ever made".
A sequel titled Caddyshack II (1988) followed, although only Chase reprised his role; it was panned by critics and a box-office bomb.</p>
