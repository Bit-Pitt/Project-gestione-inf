        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Fantozzi is a 1975 Italian satirical film, based on 1971 novel of the same name in the saga of the unlucky Italian accountant employee Ugo Fantozzi, written and played by his creator Paolo Villaggio.
The film is a parody of middle class workers of the 1970s, unhappy and frustrated at work and with family, and is known for its use of surreal humor and for several scenes which have entered popular culture.
The success of this movie rendered it a cult film that topped IT box office on sales for eight months. In the decades since its release, the film's reputation has remained almost unmutated, launching Paolo Villaggio's career. Its success led to a franchise of nine sequels, from 1976 to 1999.
In 2008, the film was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritageâ€™s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that "have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978."</p>
