        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Malibu's Most Wanted is a 2003 American comedy film written by and starring Jamie Kennedy, and co-starring Taye Diggs, Anthony Anderson, Blair Underwood, Regina Hall, Damien Dante Wayans, Ryan O'Neal, and Snoop Dogg. The film is written by the creators of MADtv, Fax Bahr and Adam Small, who also serve as producers. The character of "B-Rad", a spoof of Eminem's character "B-Rabbit" in the film 8 Mile, originally appeared in Jamie Kennedy's hidden-camera show The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, but started in his stand-up routine when he was starting out.
Here, B-Rad is Brad Gluckman, the son of Senator Bill Gluckman who is running for governor of California and fears his son is a distraction on the campaign trail, with Brad's aspirations of becoming a rapper and his glamorization of gang life. To that end, Gluckman's campaign manager hires two actors to stage an abduction to bring Brad to an inner city neighborhood where he will learn to behave himself.</p>
