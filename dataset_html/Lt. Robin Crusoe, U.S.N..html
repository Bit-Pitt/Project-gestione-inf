        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1966</p>

        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Lt. Robin Crusoe U.S.N. is a 1966 American comedy film released by Walt Disney Productions, and starring Dick Van Dyke as a U.S. Navy pilot who becomes a castaway on a tropical island. Some filming took place in San Diego, while a majority of the film was shot on Kauai, Hawaii.
The story was loosely based on Daniel Defoe's classic 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. It was Walt Disney's idea to make the adaptation, and this is the only film in which he received a story credit (as "Retlaw Yensid", which is his name spelled backwards).</p>
