        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Italy</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> I vitelloni (Italian pronunciation: [i vitelˈloːni], literally "The bullocks", Romagnol slang for "The slackers" or "The layabouts") is a 1953 Italian comedy drama film directed by Federico Fellini from a screenplay written by himself, Ennio Flaiano, and Tullio Pinelli. It stars Franco Interlenghi, Alberto Sordi, Franco Fabrizi, Leopoldo Trieste, and Riccardo Fellini (the director's brother) as five young Italian men at crucial turning points in their small-town lives. Recognized as a pivotal work in Fellini's artistic evolution, the film has distinct autobiographical elements that mirror important societal changes in 1950s Italy.
Recipient of both the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion in 1953 and an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in 1958, the film was also Fellini's first commercial success. In 2008, it was included on the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage’s 100 Italian films to be saved, a list of 100 films that "have changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978".</p>
