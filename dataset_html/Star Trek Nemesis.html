        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Star Trek: Nemesis is a 2002 American science fiction film directed by Stuart Baird. It is the tenth film in the Star Trek franchise, and the fourth and final film to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was written by John Logan from a story developed by Logan, Brent Spiner, and producer Rick Berman. In the film, the crew of the Starship Enterprise deal with the threat posed by a clone of Captain Jean-Luc Picard named Shinzon, who has taken control of the Romulan Star Empire in a coup d'Ã©tat.
Principal photography for the film took place from November 2001 to March 2002. Nemesis held its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on December 9, 2002.
The film was released in North America on December 13, 2002 by Paramount Pictures, and received generally negative reviews; it has been cited as one of the worst films in the franchise. The film was a box office failure, earning $67 million worldwide against a $60 million budget. Plans for another film featuring The Next Generation cast were scrapped, and the film series was rebooted instead with Star Trek in 2009. The television series Star Trek: Picard, a continuation of The Next Generation and Nemesis set two decades after the latter at the end of the 24th century, premiered in 2020.</p>
