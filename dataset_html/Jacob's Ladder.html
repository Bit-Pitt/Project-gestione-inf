        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Jacob's Ladder (Biblical Hebrew: סֻלָּם יַעֲקֹב‎, romanized: Sūllām Yaʿăqōḇ) is a ladder or staircase leading to Heaven that was featured in a dream the Biblical Patriarch Jacob had during his flight from his brother Esau in the Book of Genesis (chapter 28).
The significance of the dream has been debated, but most interpretations agree that it identified Jacob with the obligations and inheritance of the people chosen by God, as understood in Abrahamic religions.</p>
