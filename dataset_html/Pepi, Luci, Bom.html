        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Pepi, Luci, Bom (Spanish: Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del montón; also known as Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom and Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap) is a 1980 Spanish black comedy film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar. Starring Carmen Maura, Eva Siva, Alaska and Félix Rotaeta, the plot follows the wild adventures of three friends: Pepi, an independent modern woman; Luci, a mousy, masochistic housewife; and Bom, a lesbian punk rock singer.
Pepi, Luci, Bom is Almodóvar's first feature film. It was shot in 16 mm and blown up to 35 mm for its theatrical release. It became a cult film, emblematic of La Movida Madrileña, a period characterised by a sense of cultural and sexual freedom.</p>
