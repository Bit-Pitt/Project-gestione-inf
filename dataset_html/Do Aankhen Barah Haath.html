        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Do Aankhen Barah Haath (transl.â€‰Two Eyes, Twelve Hands) is a 1957 Indian Hindi-language drama film directed by V. Shantaram, who also starred. It is considered to be one of the classics of Hindi cinema and is based on humanistic psychology. It won a Silver Bear at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival and a Golden Globe Award in the Samuel Goldwyn International Film Award for best film produced outside of the United States category. The film is also remembered for the song "Aye Maalik Tere Bande Hum", sung by Lata Mangeshkar and written by Bharat Vyas.
The inspiration for this movie was a real experiment conducted by Maurice Frydman, who refused to have his name credited at the end of the film. He went so far as to tell the movie maker, V Shantaram, that he would sue him in court if his name were to appear anywhere in the credits. This incident is related in an interview of David Godman, who talks about Maurice Frydman's extraordinary life and connection to India.
The film was inspired by the story of an "open prison" experiment: Swatantrapur in the princely state of Aundh near Satara. Now, Swatantrapur is part of Atpadi tehsil in Sangli district of Maharashtra. It was recounted by screenwriter G. D. Madgulkar to V. Shantaram. In 2005, Indiatimes Movies ranked the movie amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. During filming, V. Shantaram fought with a bull and injured an eye, but his eyesight survived. The film was later remade in 1975 as the Tamil language film Pallandu Vazhga and in 1976 as the Telugu language film Maa Daivam. The core plot line is thematically similar to the 1952 movie My Six Convicts.</p>
