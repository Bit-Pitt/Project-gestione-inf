        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Carry On Henry is a 1971 British historical comedy film, the 21st release in the series of 31 Carry On films (1958â€“1992). It tells a fictionalised story involving Sid James as Henry VIII, who chases after Barbara Windsor's character Bettina. 
The film is based on the "secret history" concept, with a manuscript revealing that Henry VIII had two additional wives. A widowed Henry VIII has a marriage of state to Marie of Normandy, the favourite cousin of King Francis I of France. Henry does not consummate the marriage, because he is repulsed by her habit of eating garlic before coitus. Marie starts an extramarital affair with a courtier. When Henry realizes that his wife is pregnant by another man, he tries to get rid of her without negating his alliance to Francis. He eventually agrees to acknowledge Marie's child as his own, but he is determined to marry his new love interest Catherine Howard.</p>
