(transl. Will you be my friend!) is a 2002 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film directed by Kunal Kohli and produced by Yash Chopra for his banner, Yash Raj Films. The film stars Hrithik Roshan, Rani Mukerji and Kareena Kapoor in the lead roles, with Uday Chopra in a supporting role. The film follows the love triangle of 3 childhood friends: Pooja (Mukerji), Raj (Roshan) and Tina (Kapoor).
Mujhse Dosti Karoge! marked the directorial debut of Kohli, who also wrote the dialogue and co-wrote the screenplay and story with Aditya Chopra. The film's cinematography was jointly handled by Ravi K. Chandran and Gopal Shah, while Rahul Sharma served as the soundtrack composer.
Made on a budget of ₹120 million (US$1.4 million), Mujhse Dosti Karoge! was released on 9 August 2002. Despite much hype due to its A-list star-cast, it failed to attract an audience, grossing ₹336.1 million (US$3.9 million), and received mixed reviews from critics upon release. It became the sixth highest-grossing film of the year.
For her performance, Kapoor was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 4th IIFA Awards. Mujhse Dosti Karoge! marked the only film collaboration between Roshan and Mukherji.</p>
