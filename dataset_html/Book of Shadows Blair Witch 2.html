        <h1>Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2000</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> horror film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 is a 2000 American horror film directed and co-written by Joe Berlinger and starring Jeffrey Donovan, Stephen Barker Turner, Kim Director, Erica Leerhsen, and Tristine Skyler. Its plot revolves around a group of people fascinated by the mythology surrounding the film The Blair Witch Project; they go into the Black Hills where the original film was shot and experience supernatural phenomena and psychological unraveling. Despite being a sequel, it does not feature any Found footage formats.
Originally conceived by Berlinger and co-writer Dick Beebe as a psychological thriller and meditation on mass hysteria, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 was significantly altered in postproduction, which Berlinger would later claim compromised his original vision. Among the changes were a new soundtrack, additional editing, and the integration of entirely new sequences.
The film was released in theaters in North America and the United Kingdom on October 27, 2000 and was panned by critics, but grossed a worldwide total of $47.7 million against a budget of $15 million.</p>
