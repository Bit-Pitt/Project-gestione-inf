        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Madwoman of Chaillot (French: La Folle de Chaillot, pronounced [la fɔl də ʃajo]) is a play, a poetic satire, by French dramatist Jean Giraudoux, written in 1943 and first performed in 1945, after his death. The play is in two acts.  The story concerns an eccentric woman who lives in Paris and her struggles against the straitlaced authority figures in her life.
The original production was done with Giraudoux's frequent collaborator, actor and theater director Louis Jouvet, who played the Ragpicker.  The French actress Marguerite Moreno was the inspiration for the piece. The play has frequently been revived in France, with the title role played by Edwige Feuillère, Madeleine Robinson, or Judith Magre.</p>
