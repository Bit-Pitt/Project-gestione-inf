        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Speed Racer, also known as Mach GoGoGo (Japanese: マッハGoGoGo(ゴーゴーゴー), Hepburn: Mahha GōGōGō), is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuo Yoshida. It was originally serialized in print in Shueisha's 1966 Shōnen Book. It was released in tankōbon form by Sun Wide Comics and later re-released in Japan by Fusosha. Adapted into anime by Tatsunoko Production, its 52 episodes aired on Fuji Television from April 1967 to March 1968. In the US, the show aired in syndication at approximately the same time. The anime was later re-broadcast on Tokyo MX from July 1 to September 25, 2008.
Selected chapters of the manga were released by NOW Comics in the 1990s under the title Speed Racer Classics. These were later released by Wildstorm Productions, a division of DC Comics, as Speed Racer: The Original Manga. In 2008, under its Americanized title, Speed Racer, Mach GoGoGo was republished in its entirety in the United States by Digital Manga Publishing and was released as a box set to commemorate the franchise's 40th anniversary, as well as serving as a tie-in with the 2008 film. The television series was very successful in the United States and is said to have defined anime in that country until the 1990s, being watched by a total estimated audience of 40 million viewers during the 1960s–1970s.</p>
