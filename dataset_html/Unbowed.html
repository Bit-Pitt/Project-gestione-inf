        <h1>Unbowed</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2011</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> drama film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> South Korea</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Unbowed (Korean: 부러진 화살; RR: Bureojin Hwasal; lit. "Broken Arrow") is a 2011 South Korean legal drama film starring Ahn Sung-ki and Park Won-sang. It was inspired by the true story of Kim Myung-ho, a math professor who was arrested for shooting a crossbow at the presiding judge of his appeal against wrongful dismissal.
This was director Chung Ji-young's first film after a 13-year hiatus and it received a 13-minute ovation at its 2011 Busan International Film Festival premiere.
Unbowed was produced and distributed by Aura Pictures on a low budget of ₩1.5 billion which included marketing and ₩500 million for production. Ji-yeong said making the film would not have been possible without the actors' willingness to work for very little pay, commending their passion.
After it was released in theaters on January 18, 2012, the outrage resonated with South Korean viewers, and word of mouth turned it into an unexpected box office hit with 3.4 million tickets sold.</p>
