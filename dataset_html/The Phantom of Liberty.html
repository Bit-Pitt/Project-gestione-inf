        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Phantom of Liberty (French: Le Fantôme de la liberté) is a 1974 surrealist comedy drama film co-written and directed by Luis Buñuel, produced by Serge Silberman and starring Adriana Asti, Julien Bertheau and Jean-Claude Brialy. It features a nonlinear plot structure that consists of various otherwise unrelated episodes linked only by the movement of certain characters from one situation to another and exhibits Buñuel's typical ribald satirical humor combined with a series of increasingly outlandish and far-fetched incidents intended to challenge the viewer's pre-conceived notions about the stability of social mores and reality. The Phantom of Liberty was critically acclaimed and is considered to be one of Buñuel's best films.</p>
