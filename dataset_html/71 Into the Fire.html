        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> 71: Into the Fire (Korean: 포화 속으로) is a 2010 South Korean war drama film directed by John H. Lee and starring Cha Seung-won, Kwon Sang-woo, Choi Seung-hyun, and Kim Seung-woo. The film was made in commemoration of those who fought during the Korean War.
The film is based on a true story of a group of 71 undertrained and underarmed, outgunned student volunteer soldiers of South Korea during the Korean War, who were mostly killed on August 11, 1950, during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. For 11 hours, they defended the local P'ohang girls' middle school, a strategic point for safeguarding the struggling Nakdong River perimeter, from an attack by overwhelming North Korean forces, specifically the feared 766th Unit.</p>
