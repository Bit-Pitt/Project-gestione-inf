        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1993</p>

        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> American Ninja V is a 1993 American martial arts action film starring David Bradley and Lee Reyes. It was directed by Bobby Jean Leonard and written by John Bryant Hedber, Greg Latter and George Saunders. It is the fifth and final installment in the American Ninja franchise. The film is set in Los Angeles, Rome and Venezuela. This film was not originally intended to be part of the American Ninja franchise. Cannon Pictures made it under the title American Dragons (it is even shown on many cable TV stations with this title) but the title was changed to American Ninja V before release. This explains why star David Bradley plays Joe, a different character than the Sean Davidson character he played in American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt and American Ninja 4: The Annihilation. The working title was Little Ninja Man.</p>
