        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1978</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Poland</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> What Will You Do When You Catch Me? (Polish: Co mi zrobisz, jak mnie złapiesz?) is a Polish comedy film released in 1978, directed by Stanisław Bareja.
What Will You Do shares many themes with Bareja's other comedies, especially Teddy Bear, with an emphasis on the sheer absurdity of life under Communism. The plot is very convoluted similarly to other Bareja's screwball comedies and includes many interconnected storylines as well as scenes of the day to day lives of the hapless citizens of Warsaw.</p>
