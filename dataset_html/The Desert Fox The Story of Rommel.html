        <h1>The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1951</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> war film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Desert Fox is a 1951 American biographical war film from 20th Century Fox about the role of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in World War II. It stars James Mason in the title role, was directed by Henry Hathaway, and was based on the book Rommel: The Desert Fox by Brigadier Desmond Young, who served in the British Indian Army in North Africa.
The movie played a significant role in the creation of the Rommel myth: that Rommel was an apolitical, brilliant commander, opposed Nazi policies and was a victim of the Third Reich because of his participation in the conspiracy to remove Adolf Hitler from power in 1944.
The black and white format facilitated the use of large sections of actual documentary footage of World War II throughout the film. Finnish president and Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim's personal Mercedes-Benz 770, a gift received from Adolf Hitler, was used as a prop car during the film's shooting.</p>
