        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1972</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Western film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Spain</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> This list of Euro-Western films includes Western-genre films made in Europe by non-Italian production companies, although the term Euro-Western can sometimes include the Italian-produced spaghetti Western subgenre.
Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed sauerkraut Westerns because they were made in Germany and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist Karl May, and were film adaptations of May's work. One of the most popular German Western franchises was the Winnetou series, which featured a Native American Apache hero in the lead role.
Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including: Kristian Levring's The Salvation, Martin Koolhoven's Brimstone and Andreas Prochaska's The Dark Valley.</p>
