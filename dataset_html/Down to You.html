        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Down to You is a 2000 American romantic comedy film written and directed by Kris Isacsson, starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles as young lovers who meet in college and go through the ups and downs of a relationship. Selma Blair, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Ashton Kutcher, Rosario Dawson, Lucie Arnaz, and Henry Winkler play supporting roles. Isacsson's first and only theatrical feature film, Down to You paired Prinze and Stiles a year after their respective starring roles in the successful high school-set romantic comedies She's All That and 10 Things I Hate About You. The released version of the film was very different than the screenplay and the director's original cut, due to extensive post-production ordered by Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein. Despite being the second-highest grossing film at the domestic box office its opening weekend, the film was panned by critics, and grossed $24.4 million against its $11 million budget.</p>
