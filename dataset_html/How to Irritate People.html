        <h1>How to Irritate People</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1968</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United Kingdom</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> How to Irritate People is a 1968 British mockumentary sketch comedy television special recorded in the UK at LWT on 14 November 1968 and written by John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Marty Feldman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. Cleese, Chapman, and Brooke-Taylor also feature in it, along with future Monty Python collaborators Michael Palin and Connie Booth.
In various sketches, Cleese demonstrates exactly what the title suggestsâ€”how to irritate people, although this is done in a much more conventional way than the absurdity and surrealism of similar Monty Python sketches.</p>
