        <h1>Little Annie Rooney</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1925</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> silent film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Little Annie Rooney is a comic strip about a young orphaned girl who traveled about with her dog, Zero.
King Features Syndicate launched the strip on January 10, 1927, not long after it was apparent that the Chicago Tribune Syndicate had scored a huge hit with Little Orphan Annie. The name comes from the 1889 popular song of the same name, still familiar to many at the time. Although the King Features strip was an obvious knock-off with several similar parallels, the approach was quite different, and Little Annie Rooney had a successful run from January 10, 1927, to April 16, 1966.</p>
