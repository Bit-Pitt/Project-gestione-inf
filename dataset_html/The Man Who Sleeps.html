        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> The Man Who Sleeps (French: Un homme qui dort) is a 1974 French drama film directed by Bernard Queysanne and Georges Perec, based on Perec's 1967 novel A Man Asleep. 
The story centers on an unnamed university student, referred to as "you" by the narrator, as he suddenly quits attending school, cuts off his friends, and attempts to lead a fully automation-like life devoid of human interaction. His inner thoughts are narrated in the form of an unwritten diary by Ludmila MikaÃ«l in the original French version, and Shelley Duvall in English. A sense of paranoia and claustrophobia develops until he ultimately determines that, no matter what he does, life is futile. As a result, he dismisses isolation as a radical practice, and returns to normal life. 
The film is the directorial debut of both Bernard Queysanne and Georges Perec. The film's script is borrowed completely from the text of the novel itself, though many parts were condensed to be brought to screen. The film was almost lost before being restored on DVD in 2007. The film's script is lifted exactly from the novel, though condensed. 
The film was a small critical success, with reviewers citing its psychological drama and unique filmic structure. The film won the Prix Jean Vigo in 1974.</p>
