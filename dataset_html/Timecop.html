        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1994</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> action film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Canada</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Timecop is a 1994 American science fiction action film directed by Peter Hyams and co-written by Mike Richardson and Mark Verheiden. Richardson also served as executive producer. The film is based on Timecop, a story created by Richardson, written by Verheiden, and drawn by Ron Randall, which appeared in the anthology comic Dark Horse Comics, published by Dark Horse Comics.  It is the first installment in the Timecop franchise.
The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Max Walker, a police officer in 1994, with time travel having been made possible, and later a U.S. federal agent in 2004. It also stars Ron Silver as a corrupt politician and Mia Sara as Melissa Walker, the agent's wife. The story follows Walker's life as he fights time-travel crime and investigates the politician's plans.
Timecop remains Van Damme's highest-grossing film as a lead actor (his second to break the $100 million barrier worldwide).  Although met with mixed reviews, it is generally regarded by critics as one of Van Damme's best films.</p>
