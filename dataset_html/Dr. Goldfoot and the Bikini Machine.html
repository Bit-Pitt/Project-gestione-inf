        <h1>Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine</h1>
        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1965</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> United States</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine is a 1965 Path√©color comedy film directed by Norman Taurog and distributed by American International Pictures. Starring Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman, Susan Hart and Jack Mullaney, and featuring Fred Clark, the film is a parody of the then-popular spy trend (the title is a spoof of two James Bond films: the 1962 film Dr. No and the 1964 hit Goldfinger), made using actors from AIP's beach party and Edgar Allan Poe films. The film was retitled Dr G. and the Bikini Machine in England due to a threatened lawsuit from Eon, holder of the rights to the James Bond series.
Hickman called it "AIP's attempt to combine horror, bikini babe and secret agents and take advantage of the popularity of the James Bond pictures."
Despite its low production values, the film has achieved a certain cult status for the appearance of horror legend Price and AIP's beach party film alumni, its in-jokes and over-the-top sexuality, the claymation title sequence designed by Art Clokey, and a title song performed by The Supremes. Its success led to a sequel, produced in 1966, entitled Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs.</p>
