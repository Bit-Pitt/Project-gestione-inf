        <p><strong>Year:</strong> 1931</p>
        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> comedy film</p>
        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Germany</p>
        <p><strong>Plot:</strong> Emil and the Detectives (German: Emil und die Detektive) is a 1929 novel set mainly in Berlin, by the German writer Erich K채stner and illustrated by Walter Trier. It was K채stner's first major success and the only one of his pre-1945 works to escape Nazi censorship. The book was immediately popular and the original version sold an initial two million copies. First published in English in 1931, it has never been out of print and has been translated into at least 59 languages.
It is K채stner's best-known work. Compared with children's literature of the time, its most unusual aspect was its realistic setting in a contemporary Berlin peopled with some fairly rough characters rather than a sanitized fantasy world; also that it refrained from obvious moralizing, letting the characters' deeds speak for themselves. Emil was the first name of K채stner's father.</p>
